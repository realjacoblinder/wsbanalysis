They run the most profitable network portfolio in the paid cable game (Discovery Channel, TLC, HGTV, Animal Planet, Food Network, HGTV, and Travel Channel). Their networks are the #1 (TLC) and #2 (HGTV) for female viewers in domestic markets. They also have the largest sports network in all of Europe and are prepared to deal with that during the pandemic.\\n\\nOn their earnings call last week they said they were going to announce a new AVOD service/partnership in early December. Their current one is already doing well, their next will be even better. The rumor is coming from the CEO, so I'm fucking buying it.
