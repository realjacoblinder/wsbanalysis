    "<p>The core of the data collection method is scraping text from posts and comments on Reddit in search of stock market positions. This is simple for the ideal case, where a given comment will have a string of text in the format of the stock ticker, date, strike price, and option type (put or call). PSTH 3/19/21 20c, for example, would be a relatively simple string to parse as it provides all of the required information in sequence. Unfortunately, no standardized format is enforced; this means that the same information could be communicated by any permutation containing all four items or even using full sentences with context elsewhere in the post. By not having adequately sophisticated parsing, it is probable that the amount of data collected will be significantly less than what is totally available. \n",
