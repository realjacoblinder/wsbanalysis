I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 28th, 2019.\n\n# **The Fed and Apple earnings will make or break market\u2019s return to record highs in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/25/the-fed-could-be-what-makes-or-breaks-the-stock-markets-push-into-record-territory.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks will try in the week ahead to break the all-time highs set earlier in the year as a slew of S&amp;P 500 companies get set to report.\n*****\n&gt; Stock prices are bumping up against their highs, but whether they can burst through and hold gains may, for the near term, depend on what investors hear from Jerome Powell in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; In a week stacked with major events, the Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is likely to be the high point. The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to make its third quarter point interest rate cut Wednesday afternoon, followed by comments form Fed Chairman Powell. Those comments could be his most important message of the next few months, as investors watch to see whether he holds the door open to future rate cuts, or signals it\u2019s time to pause, as some economists expect.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur view is they\u2019ll be done after this. We\u2019re not expecting a cut in December, and we\u2019re not expecting cuts next year. The economy, in my mind, looks like it\u2019s stabilizing, and there should be more evidence of that in the next couple of weeks. focusing on the labor market is the key thing,\u201d said Drew Matus, chief market strategist at MetLife Investment Management. If the labor market holds up, expectations for rate cuts should decline. \u201cI do think the dissenters are arguing they shouldn\u2019t be cutting at all.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Matus\u2019 view is just one of many on Wall Street. Some economists expect another cut in December, while others expect one or more cuts next year, depending on how they view the economy. Goldman Sachs economists laid out a case where the Fed will clearly signal that it plans to pause after Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; All of this could make for volatility in stocks and bonds, depending on which market view prevails in Powell\u2019s comments. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be choppy going into the Fed,\u201d said Andrew Brenner of National Alliance. In the past week, yields were higher with the 10-year Treasury yield touching 1.8% Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 1.2% for the week, ending at 3,022, just below its closing high. On Friday, it briefly traded above the July 26 high of 3,025. The Dow ended the week with a gain of 0.7%, at 26,956, and it remains about 1% below its closing high.\n*****\n&gt; In addition, the earnings calendar remains heavy with about 145 S&amp;P 500 companies releasing earnings, including Alphabet Monday and big oil Exxon Mobil and Chevron Friday. On Wednesday, earnings are expected from Apple, which is setting new highs of its own.\n*****\n&gt; # Big economic reports\n\n&gt; On top of that, November kicks off Friday in what looks to be the most important day for economic data of the new month. Besides the critical monthly employment report, there is the key ISM manufacturing report, expected to show a contraction in manufacturing activity for a third month.\n*****\n&gt; Both reports could be distorted by the GM strike, which is expected to result in an October employment report with fewer than 100,000 jobs. According to Refinitiv, total non farm payrolls are expected to be 90,000, while manufacturing jobs are expected to decline by 50,000. That would include the impact of GM workers, but also the employees of the many suppliers and services that support the car company\u2019s manufacturing operations.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe jobs number will be big, but the ISM could be bigger. If that turns up, like Markit [PMI] suggested, that could be a big deal,\u201d said Leuthold Group Chief Investment Strategist James Paulsen. On Thursday, Markit flash PMI manufacturing data for October was higher than expected, and still has not shown a contraction.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf it turns up, I think that\u2019s to affect a lot of people and how they feel about things. That could take on a whole new dimension of what happens to Wall Street earnings estimates,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Manufacturing data has dragged, due to the impact of tariffs and the trade war, and some big companies have taken a hit as a result, like Caterpillar which on Wednesday reported weaker than expected earnings and sales. Caterpillar also cut its outlook, in large part due to weakness in China. Caterpillar shares were slammed but on Friday, the stock was bouncing back by 3.5%.\n*****\n&gt; # Stocks at \u2018inflection point\u2019\n\n&gt; Quincy Krosby, Prudential Financial\u2019s chief market strategist, said the fact Caterpillar was able to come back at the end of the week was a positive for the market, which she says is now entering the late year seasonal period where stocks typically do well. At the same time, she said news for the market looks like it\u2019s about to get \u201cless bad.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u2033\u2033Less bad\u2019 is not a full fledged agreement with China. Less bad is a truce. It means that Dec. 15 extension in tariffs does not happen,\u201d she said, adding the market appears to be at an inflection point with investors expecting an agreement of some type between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping when they meet in November.\n*****\n&gt; \u2033\u2018I\u2019m not bullish. I\u2019m not bearish. I\u2019m optimistic. This market has been led by the defensive sectors. You\u2019re starting to see that move into consumer discretionary. It\u2019s telling you the market is seeing growth, albeit it not stellar growth, but when it gets \u2018less bad\u2019 you\u2019re going to see that it\u2019s being reflected in this inflection point in the market,\u201d said said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a move more and more into the cyclical and growth sectors, and by the way, we\u2019re seeing a steepening of the yield curve.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The yield curve represents the difference between the yields of two different duration Treasury securities. When the curve inverts, the yield on the shorter duration security, in this case the 2-year has become higher than that of say, the 10-year. That is one part of the curve that was temporarily inverted, and if it stayed inverted it would be a recession warning.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year has been moving higher, and the 1.80% level will be important if the yield can stay above it.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf it pushes through 1.80, you\u2019re going to take the inversion out, by the bond market, not the Fed,\u201d Paulsen said. Paulsen said it would be a sign of confidence in the economy if yields can push higher.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed taking a pause may add to that sense. \u201cI think most people think one more cut and done,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bigger news will be what [Powell] says in that press conference. He can go pretty off script sometimes.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018Greater optimsim\u2019 in market\n\n&gt; Paulsen said stocks could be in a good period, and earnings news seems to be already priced in. \u201cThe data by and large has been okay. You have earnings that are okay, and there\u2019s no sense of imminent recession. It just seems there\u2019s greater optimism,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Of the approximately 200 S&amp;P companies that reported by Friday morning, more than 78% have beaten on earnings per share, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Earnings are expected to decline by 2% for the third quarter, based on estimates and results from companies that already reported.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said there\u2019s some sense in the market that Brexit will not end in a worst case scenario, but it is something to watch in the week ahead as British lawmakers decide whether to hold an election.\n*****\n&gt; Jack Ablin, chief investment officer with Cresset Wealth Advisors, said he thinks Brexit would be a bigger deal than the trade agreement for the world economy, if it goes poorly, with the U.K. leaving the European Union with no deal. \u201cA no deal Brexit is likely to take 2 percentage points off of British growth...It would take 1% off European growth...I think that\u2019s significant,\u201d Ablin said. \u201cI think investors are underplaying it because it\u2019s so binary. It\u2019s hard to position for a binary outcome. If we get some resolution there, to me, that has the biggest impact for the markets.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/mMPvzgL.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/qfH6cuI.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/2Fl3u1U.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/d0KYXSh.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mQYD2ay.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fARcwR4.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NPhYaGZ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JwfHb1k.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5DjAHjt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/aJoKnw0.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/3GQMBSo.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/4zFdNBR.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Oj3izCL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/4BShjBk.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Bullish Halloween Trading Strategy Treat Next Week\n\n&gt; Next week provides a special short-term seasonal opportunity, one of the most consistent of the year. The last 4 trading days of October and the first 3 trading days of November have a stellar record the last 25 years. From the tables below:\n* Dow up 19 of last 25 years, average gain 2.1%, median gain 1.4%.\n* S&amp;P up 21 of last 25 years, average gain 2.1%, median gain 1.5%.\n* NASDAQ up 21 of last 25 years, average gain 2.7%, median gain 2.3%.\n* Russell 2000 19 of last 25 years, average gain 2.2%, median gain 2.5%.\n\n&gt; Many refer to our Best Six Months Tactical Seasonal Switching Strategy as the Halloween Indicator or Halloween Strategy and of course \u201cSell in May\u201d. These catch phrases highlight our discovery that was first published in 1986 in the 1987 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac that most of the market\u2019s gains are made from October 31 to April 30, while the market goes sideways to down from May through October.\n\n&gt; Since 1950 DJIA is up 7.5% November-April and up only 0.6% May-October. We encouraged folks not to fear Octoberphobia early this month and wait for our MACD Buy Signal which came on October 11. We have been positioning more bullishly since in sector and major U.S. market ETFs and with a new basket of stocks.

However, the month has taken hits during bear markets and November 2000, down \u201322.9% (undecided election and a nascent bear), was NASDAQ\u2019s second worst month on record\u2014only October 1987 was worse.\n\n&gt; November begins the \u201cBest Six Months\u201d for the DJIA and S&amp;P 500, and the \u201cBest Eight Months\u201d for NASDAQ. Small caps come into favor during November, but don\u2019t really take off until the last two weeks of the year. November is the number-two DJIA (since 1950), NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 2000 (since 1979) month. November is best for S&amp;P 500 (since 1950) and Russell 1000\u2019s (since 1979).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ef59a01a84a6391160b8624e5d05acf0/795865009b4c2002-94/s400x600/2d11d5ae114446e6162b685da1210ec1c8e83e73.jpg))**\n\n&gt; In pre-election years, November\u2019s performance is noticeably weaker. DJIA has advanced in nine of the last 17 pre-election years since 1950 with an average gain of 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 has been up in 10 of the past 17 pre-election years, also gaining on average a rather paltry 0.3%. Small-caps and techs perform better with Russell 2000 climbing in 6 of the past 10 pre-election years, averaging 1.2%. NASDAQ has been up in 7 of the last 12 pre-election year Novembers with an average 0.9% gain. Contributing to pre-election year November\u2019s weaker performance are nasty declines in 1987, 1991 and 2007.\n\n*****\n\n# Q4 Rally Is Real. Don\u2019t Let 2018 Spook You\n\n&gt; Understandably folks are apprehensive about the perennial fourth quarter rally this year after the debacle that culminated in the Christmas Eve Crumble in 2018. But the history is clear. The fourth quarter is the best quarter of the year going back to 1949, except for NASDAQ where Q1 leads Q4 by 4.5% to 4.0%, since 1971.\n\n&gt; Historically, the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-Year Election Cycle is the three-quarter span from Q4 Midterm Year through Q2 Pre-Election Year, averaging a gain of 19.3% for DJIA and 20.0% for S&amp;P 500 since 1949 and 29.3% for NASDAQ since 1971. Conversely the weakest two-quarter span is Q2-Q3 of the Midterm Year, averaging a loss of -1.2% for DJIA and -1.5% for S&amp;P 500 since 1949 and -5.0% for NASDAQ since 1971.\n\n&gt; Market action was impacted by some more powerful forces in 2018 that trumped (no pun intended) seasonality. Q2-Q3 was up 9.8% for DJIA, 10.3% for S&amp;P and 13.9% for NASDAQ. Q4 was horrible, down -11.8% for DJIA, -14.0% for S&amp;P and -17.5% for NASDAQ.Q1-Q2 of pre-election year, especially Q1 gained all that back.\n\n&gt; Pre-Election year Q4 is still one of the best quarters of the 4-Year Cycle, ranked 5th, for average gains of 2.6% for DJIA and 3.2% for S&amp;P since 1949 and 5.4% for NASDAQ. Additionally, from the Pre-Election Seasonal Pattern we updated in last Friday\u2019s post, you can see how the market tends to make a high near yearend in the Pre-Election Year. So, save some new unexpected outside event, Q4 Market Magic is expected to impress once again this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dbbf895b45f184b03a00b205d9d5fb01/50dce02940c8c467-9c/s500x750/aa060bb5f968ea0e9de159e18bbf348ab8f21ee0.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# 2019 May Be One of the Best Years Ever\n\n&gt; \u201cEverything is awesome, when you\u2019re living out a dream.\u201d The Lego Movie\n\n&gt; As the S&amp;P 500 Index continues to flirt with new record highs, something under the surface is taking place that is making 2019 extremely special. Or dare we say, \u201cawesome\u201d.\n\n&gt; First, let\u2019s look back at last year. 2018 was the first year since 1969 in which both the S&amp;P 500 (stocks) and the 10-year Treasury bond (bonds) both finished the year with a negative return. Toss in the fact that gold and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil were both down last year, and it was one of the worst years ever for a diversified portfolio.\n\n&gt; \u201cAs bad as last year was for investors, 2019 is a mirror image, with stocks, bonds, gold, and crude oil all potentially finishing the year up double digits for the first time in history,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, it has been a great year for stocks, bonds, gold, and crude oil. Of course, there are still more than two months to go in 2019, but this year is shaping up to be one of the best years ever for these four important assets.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/great-year-for-assets_1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# An Early Look at Earnings\n\n&gt; We're now in the thick of the Q3 earnings reporting period with 130 companies reporting since just the close last night. As shown in our Earnings Explorer snapshot below, earnings will be in overdrive for the next two weeks before dying down in mid-November.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/explorer.png))**\n\n&gt; Through yesterday's close, 248 companies had reported so far this season, and 75% of them had beaten consensus bottom-line EPS estimates. However, just 63% of stocks have beaten sales estimates, and more companies have lowered guidance than raised guidance. In terms of stock price reaction to reports this season, so far investors have seen earnings as relatively bullish as the average stock that has reported has gained 0.60% on its earnings reaction day. Below we show another snapshot from our Earnings Explorer featuring the aggregate results of this season's reports and a list of the stocks that have reacted the most positively to earnings. Four stocks so far have gained more than 20% on their earnings reaction days -- PETS, BIIB, APHA, and LLNW.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/epsstats.png))**\n\n&gt; We provide clients with a beat-rate monitor on our Earnings Explorer page as well. Below is a chart showing the rolling 3-month EPS and sales beat rates for US companies over the last 5 years. After a dip in the EPS beat rate earlier in the year, we've seen it steadily increase over the last few months up to its current level of 64.46%. That's more than five percentage points above the historical average of 59.37%.\n\n&gt; In terms of sales, 57.87% of companies have beaten top-line estimates over the last 3 months, which is much closer to the historical average than the bottom-line beat rate.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/epsbeatrate.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Banks - On To The Next Test\n\n&gt; It has been a pretty monumental two weeks for the KBW Bank index. Since the close on 10/8, the index has rallied just under 9% as earnings reports from some of the largest US banks received a warm welcome from Wall Street. The index is now once again testing the top-end of its range, one which it has unsuccessfully tested multiple times in the last year. If you think the repeated tests of 3,000 for the S&amp;P 500 over the last 18 months have been dramatic, the current go around with 103 for the KBW Bank Index has been the sixth such test in the last year! We would also note that prior to last year's fourth quarter downturn, the same level that has been acting as resistance for the KBW Bank index was previously providing support.\n\n&gt; In the case of each prior failed break above 103 for the KBW Bank index, sell-offs of at least 5% (and usually 10%+) followed, but one thing the index has going for it even if the sixth time isn't the charm is that just yesterday it broke above its downtrend that has been in place since early 2018. The group has passed one test at least! From here, if we do see a pullback, that former downtrend line should provide support.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/102319-Banks.png))**\n\n&gt; Turning to the KBW Index's individual components, the table below lists each of the 24 stocks in the index along with how each one has performed since the index's recent low on 10/8 and on a YTD basis (sorted by performance since 10/8). In the slightly more than two weeks since the index's short-term low, every stock in the index is up and up by at least 4%. That's a pretty broad rally!\n\n&gt; Leading the way to the upside, State Street (STT) has rallied nearly 20%, while First Republic (FRC), Northern Trust (NTRS), and Bank of America (BAC) have jumped more than 13%. In the case of STT, the rally of the last two-weeks has also moved the stock into the green on a YTD basis.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/102319-Banks-List.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 25th, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKLdI1JvVH8))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.27.19**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70pZzT9B_o))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;
