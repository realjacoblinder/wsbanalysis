Here is your stock market news this AM-\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Tuesday, March 24th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/24/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-24-2020.html)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures hit their 5% “limit up” levels Tuesday as top Senate and White House officials neared a $2 trillion deal to rescue the economy from the coronavirus crisis. The exchange-traded fund that tracks the Dow, which has no curbs, was up just over 5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 582 points or 3.1% on Monday after the Senate failed for a second time in less than 24 hours to advance the stimulus bill. Investors were more concerned about talks on Capitol Hill than encouraged by the Federal Reserve’s announcement Monday of an open-ended asset purchase program. As of Monday’s close, the lowest since November 2016, the Dow was down 37% from its record highs last month.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n&gt; * Senate Democrats expressed optimism about reaching a relief deal from the coronavirus crisis after negotiations with Trump administration officials stretched late into the night. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said talks were set to resume Tuesday morning. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi came out with House Democrats’ $2.5 trillion bill. Also on Monday, President Donald Trump suggested he wants to urge businesses to reopen, sooner rather than later. “I’m not looking at months,” the president said.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n&gt; * As Trump considers relaxing some coronavirus restrictions, the U.K. issued a stay-at-home order, starting Tuesday, allowing only essential trips. All nonessential public buildings and places are closed, ranging from libraries to churches, outdoor gyms and playgrounds. All social events including weddings and baptisms are also prohibited. In China, the two-month lockdown of most of Hubei province was lifted. However, Wuhan, the city in the province where the coronavirus originated in December, remains locked down until April 8.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n&gt; * Global coronavirus cases approached 384,000 with 16,594 deaths and nearly 102,000 recoveries, according to Johns Hopkins University data. China, at about 81,500 cases, has just 21% of the infections around the world as the spread in European nations and the United States continued to spike higher. Italy, the hardest-hit country outside China, saw cases rise to nearly 64,000. The death toll in Italy of 6,077 was nearly double that of China and the highest in the world. Cases in America increased to 46,450 with 593 deaths. Nearly half the U.S. cases and the highest U.S. death toll of 188 were in New York state.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n&gt; * Top U.S. airlines are working on plans for a possible voluntary shutdown of nearly all U.S. passenger flights, industry and federal officials told The Wall Street Journal.

Now, the latest filings we have from SPCE are from November 12th, 2019 where their market cap was under $900 million and their stock price was just over $10. Now as we know their stock closed at almost $20 today, January 22nd, but their market cap has skyrocketed to over $3.8 billion. How has this happened? Dilution which means that the company is just pumping shares into the market. Per the November 12th filings SPCE had under 83 million shares outstanding, which includes insider shares and the float shares. Today though that amount is 196 million, which means they have more than doubled their total amount of shares on the market.

       "  'Disclaimer: this is not investment advice. I could be very wrong about everything said here do your own research.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI started shorting Tesla about a year ago when I learned of their plan to completely skip production testing and go straight to ramp. Coming from an engineering background I knew how badly this would turn out and I’m convinced they’ve wasted millions of dollars (maybe billions) ramping up flawed designs (ex 14% first pass yields or scrapping tons of automation capex because they couldn’t get it to work). No matter what crazy shit went down over the past year I always remembered my original short thesis. Because they didn’t test the car and production first, they will need to continue wasting capital on low yields, and then reworks, and then warranty repairs, and then recalls. By the end there is almost no chance they will ever get positive gross margins out of this car.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMore recently however a new thesis has appeared for me.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI used to not believe in the analogy of Theranos to Tesla. Theranos was a fraud because they never had a working product and advertised they did. But with Tesla, their cars are real and tons of people buy and love them. Maybe they have unrealistic targets but that doesn’t necessarily mean they committed fraud. Recent developments have changed my mind though. I now believe “full self driving” is Tesla’s biggest and most obvious fraud, and it will bring down the company similar to how Theranos was brought down.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTesla has been advertising FSD for years as being just around the corner. They advertised the feature on their website as “pending regulatory approval” as if the only thing stopping them from releasing it is the government. If you watch the Model 3 reveal from 2 years ago Elon basically says they have it ready to go. We know now that was a lie because it is now 2 years later and it still doesn’t exist. The combination of the following have made me almost 100% certain that Tesla has been bullshitting everyone this whole time:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhen Elon said if the cars needed a new computer to have FSD, it would be a free upgrade. This was the first time he publicly backtracked on the claim that all cars are FSD ready.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhen Elon announced a new Tesla chip that would be ready in 6 months and be a free upgrade. Building chips is extremely complex and requires tons of testing and iteration to get it right. If they take the Model 3 approach to building their chip, I guarantee it won’t work and they will waste a bunch of capital trying.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe lack of FSD demos since the original one. We later learned the original one was completely staged.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe recent delay of their on-ramp to offramp mode. If they don’t have this ready now how are they close to any real self driving.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFinally, when they removed FSD from their order page. There is no reason for them to remove the option especially since they need the money now more than ever. Unless they suddenly decided it’s not a good idea to charge people for something that doesn’t exist. More likely a regulator poked them about it.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIf FSD is revealed as fake it will be massively devastating. Tesla directly took money from customers which makes it super easy to show that they profited off the charade. I think investors will soon realize that they’ve been lied to and Tesla will go down for fraud just like Theranos did.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR: I’m short TSLA initially because they didn’t test the Model 3 before releasing it, and now because I think they committed straight fraud by lying about having full self driving almost ready.'],\n",

A robust electric racing scene would translate into much faster, and more aggressive RND into electric. Better efficiency is key here to go more laps with less charge, aerodynamics improve efficiency, new ways of restoring energy in ways similar to regenerative braking, etc. These will eventually find their way into their consumer vehicles making electric better, and this more popular, faster.\\n\\nThe other big thing is, if people can see electric racecars outperforming their ICE counterparts, people who may not otherwise like the idea of electric will start to see the hype and arguments for electric.\\n\\nAll this to say, the VW announcement, in conjunction with things like Mercedes stopping further development of ICE vehicles, I think that electric is going to be showing up much faster than people originally thought.\\n\\nthe most important thing for electric to work is good infrastructure.

       "  'By Hoseex999/Achose111\\n\\nFirstly, why am I writing this? \\n\\nAfter coming to WSB my account drop a bit like 50% but now it goes 350% up due to autistic options trading that I learned here in WSB, also someone here introduced me to SPCE here on WSB and since then I follow the stock and made some good gains. So, I want to write some interesting shit in return to WSB. \\n\\nAlso, I think if I post this on r/stocks or r/investing I would be considered a heretic, be condemned for not following the guidance of the holy Intelligent Investor and be prema banned for not looking at fundamentals, so I choose to post here.\\n\\nThis thread talks about a few market bubbles, history of space industry, the potential of SPCE and the rationale behind being the grand bubble stock.\\n\\nIs gonna be long, jump to the the bubble part if you are bored.\\n\\n\\\\-----\\n\\nPreface: \\n\\nDuring the 1995-2000 Dot com Bubble, there are so many companies + useless startups that could cash in so much money by simply building some shit and claim is the future. \\n\\nFor example, Netscape without even a hint of profitability skyrocketed as high as $74.75 per share on its first day of trading before finishing the day at $58.25. The closing price valued the web browser at around $3 billion. By the end of 1995, Netscape shares traded at $174. In 1999, AOL acquired Netscape during the height of the bubble in a deal valuing the company at $10 billion. \\n\\nThis is just one small internet stock that successfully suck the cash out from retards in the dot com bubble. The larger internet company names such as yahoo, AOL, E\\\\*TRADE, eBay, Priceline.com, and Amazon.com are tracked with the by the Bloomberg US Internet Index, Before and After Dot-com Bubble, the combined market values of the 280 stocks had fallen to $1.193 trillion currently from $2.948 trillion at their peak, a loss of $1.755 trillion. See 1.\\n\\nFrom a source I forgot, during the bubble in the US there are around 3-5 thousand ppl quit their jobs and do day trading full time, 5 mil people also joined in and invested some of their cash into the tech market. While we could say the people are retard in the 2000s and lose trillions on the bubble, some of these stocks ultimately become part of our society and we become heavily reliant on these companies. \\n\\nThe point is if a person could get in into some stock bubbles and get out alive before the burst, we could get so much tendies and waste it on useless shit. (Btw, there are always a few in the market, like the small 3d printing bubble in 2013, DDD&amp; SSYS goes to 100 and goes back down, currently it still hover around 10-20)\\n\\nSo, now I would want to talk about SPCE, the history, the billionaire space race and the potential reason to become a grand meme stock.\\n\\n\\\\-----\\n\\nSpace is only for the rich:\\n\\nIn 2004, there is a competition called the Ansari X Prize, basically a few teams compete to become the first company to build a spaceship to space. Guess which team win? The answer is Scaled Composites, which later formed the spaceship company with VG and is also the company that build white knight two, the mothership ship VG is still using today. In fact, SpaceShipOne the spaceship built in 2004 could reach 112 km which is still higher than today’s VG SpaceShipTwo 90km. see 2.\\n\\nI even made a comparison photo here https://imgur.com/a/JpxcdMY , what I found was that after 15 years, while the vid quality improved quite a bit, the spaceship is mostly the same as in 2004, this is due to the fact that converting from a smaller prototype to a functional tourist spaceship is way harder then everyone could though. \\n\\n“I believe that our real significance of this program is that realization,” he said then, “and I believe that realization will attract investment, and that realization will attract a whole bunch of activity and very soon it will be affordable for you to fly.” - Burt Rutan, Engineer of SpaceShipOne in 2004 See 3.\\n\\nNow is Feb,2020 and we still haven’t sent ordinary people to space without paying 50 mil to board a Souyz to space.\\n\\nI once read that software companies are so easy to generate money because you just need to write some code, make servers, sell your services easily to audience across the globe and you could already generate income without heavy overhead costs. \\n\\nBut Space industry on the other hand is simply expensive, it requires loads of cash for everything from launching, R&amp;D, staff, etc. Sending a kg of stuff cost around 2700 USD, the ISS costs around 150 BN should show you how expensive space is. Most participants that are in the Ansari X Prize (some are listed below) go bust.\\n\\nRocketplane- Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2010\\n\\nArmadillo Aerospace-Have around 1 mil USD of investment, but in hibernation mode since 2013\\n\\nXCOR Aerospace- Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2017\\n\\nUnlike Facebook where you could build it by a few ppl in Harvard, Space companies needs loads of initial investment, staff, expensive testing costs, years of development and high failure rate means it is simply impossible for people without at least a few millions/outside investors to start a space company let alone grow it into a successful space venture.\\n\\nThus, space is a billionaire race ground. Elon, Jeff and Branson is competing with each other, they are also interestingly the only 3 people that could make Reusable launch system. See 4\\n\\n\\\\-----\\n\\nReason that SPCE becomes a bubble meme stock: \\n\\nI think everyone now should get a glimpse on why there is so many successful internet companies but so few space companies. Space is like million dollars’ + many years worth of hard and thus very few companies could become successful. But on the other hand, it gave the reason for SPCE to ascend into the ultimate meme stock.\\n\\nIn many stock market bubbles, no matter small or big like 3d printing, dot com, 2008 real estate bubble, railroad mania or the endless stock market bubbles there are always many companies that a person could invest in that sector. There are like hundreds of stocks to invest in the dot com bubble and at least dozens of 3d printing stocks to invest in the US, UK, China or in Europe \\n\\nBut what about space industry stocks? \\n\\nULA: Good luck pumping LMT and BA\\n\\nIridium: Starlink would likely make Iridium out of business, would not recommend.\\n\\nStarlink: There is likely the same or even more hype levels for Starlink then VG, but until there is an IPO, I won’t count it, even then there is a IPO, there is only two stocks that everyone would mostly trade on, VG are also on different business then Starlink so zero competition between them\\n\\nBlue Origin: Bezos is not going to IPO it, he doesn’t need to. His wealth is Blue Origin mkt cap and it currently weighs around 100+Bn\\n\\nSpaceX: Elon said he would not IPO SpaceX, so not an option too.\\n\\nChina, Russia, Japan, EU: Currently zero stocks that are passenger space/ communication related, all are either state owned or non-existence. \\n\\n\\\\-----\\n\\nThe Bubble: \\n\\nSo, here comes the point, if any fund manager unless it could buy into SpaceX via deals, normal person, boomer, millennials, people from other countries is going to buy into the space industry there is only Virgin Galactic that a person could buy (or you could buy Iridium which is gay and not recommended).\\n\\nWe all know space is going to be the future and yet I found it shocking that for an industry that has such huge potential, there are only 4 companies that represent the space industry and other are funded by governments, 2 are out of touch, ULA is only a small part of BA and LMT, so a person could only buy VG if it wants space to be a part of its portfolio.\\n\\nThis is a stark contrast to many stock bubbles where there are many choices that a person could invest on, you could buy an internet index back in the dot com boom or many real estate/bank stock choices for the 08 crisis. \\n\\nVG is the only one stock that 99% could invest on. I think this is the reason that would lead it to become a ultimate bubble stock, assuming even 0.1% of us stock investors which is around 100 thousand of people in the US invest 10k into the company, it would already add 1bn onto VG, 1 billion is pocket change for many large funds and if they want to be in part of the space race, most of them could only buy VG.\\n\\nEven a small news of relocation could jump the stock about 20% and is still up 40% since news release, imagine just releasing news such as day for launch, reopen sales, etc., when it eventually rides Branson I would not surprise it goes up 100%. After all, in the dot com bubble 500% increase from IPO is rather common, even QUALCOMM goes up around 2000% in the dot comm bubble and reach 88 in 2000, it only goes back to 88 recently and is now only 2 dollars up @ 90.56 in feb,2020. \\n\\nI think most people don’t realize how this stock could be a stock in the history books, if according to history of how bubble stock forms, the bubble would grow for a while until it reaches hype point when the US goes back to the moon in 2024 and may burst or run for 1-2 more years. \\n\\nWhile it may be a large company in the 2030-2040 like how amazon is in the 2000 and it become today, we are talking about getting in, trade in a bubble and GTFO before things goes to shit. \\n\\n\\\\-----\\n\\nConclusion: \\n\\nVG is still the only stock that represent the hype and for anyone to invest into space industry. Even if you think my analysis is retard just please don’t short the stock, you could not predict the only space stock that the public is allowed to put their money in would behave.\\n\\n1. https://money.cnn.com/2000/11/09/technology/overview/\\n\\n2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipOne\\\\_flight\\\\_17P\\n\\n3. https://spacenews.com/what-the-hell-happened-the-rise-and-fall-of-suborbital-space-tourism-companies/\\n\\n4.

There are similar companies like Farfetch but REAL seems to be more for the used goods market. (Gig economy) They don’t own any products but “verify authenticity” on goods that people sell to other buyers since heavily sold items are usually luxury handbags and goods. \\n\\nI see this can be a scalable opportunity for the company but having looked into customer reviews it seems there are tons of complaints on goods that are “fake” etc. This got me thinking, some goods don’t have their box or receipt and you are technically trusting that the company has done their due diligence. Even if you purchased a product from the company, how can they stop people from selling Grade A fakes passing it off with a receipt and box? \\n\\nScanning through some customer reviews, “fake” items or items that were received but are completely different than what was posted seem to be the current narrative. Also, trying to reach customer service on refunds and returning items seem to be a huge pain in the ass. I can also see how this could be a huge issue for REAL since it is up to their platform to “authenticate” all these goods. \\n\\nThe current CEO  of REAL is Julie Wainwright who ran Pets.com and probably was one of the shortest run IPO ever and we know that was a huge flop.\\n\\nFarfetch is a similar ecommerce site that sells luxury brands for a discount but FTCH is currently trading at 8 dollars from its 20 dollar IPO price as well. FTCH does have more shares out than REAL but is also not completely focused on the “used” goods market. \\n\\nGoing from what we’ve seen so far from ecommerce type companies this year including PINS, FTCH, I’m seeing this as an opportunity to short the shit out of this one. \\n\\nYes Burberry announced a partnership with REAL, but this seems to already be priced in from the recent movements. \\n\\nAlso another important point here is that Jim Cramer has been bigly bullish on REAL, and doing the inverse of him usually pans out well.\\n\\n\\nAnyone give me a reason why I shouldn’t short the shit out of this one come monday?'],\n",

Retest is possible, but I expect a potential breakdown to retouch the trend line around 255-260. **This is just short-term speculation for long-dated entry point on puts.** The thesis is SPY retest of lows, and I find more comfort with longer expiries (hence June 30th).

Later in the morning, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell talks at a Brookings Institution webinar about the central bank’s coronavirus intervention measures. The stock market is closed Friday in observance of Good Friday. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained nearly 780 points, or 3.4%, after Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Democratic presidential nomination race. It relieved some of Wall Street’s political concerns as daily increases in U.S. and global coronavirus cases have slowed since last Friday. The Dow, as of Wednesday’s close, was still more than 20% off its record high in February. Depressed oil prices were getting a pop early Thursday on expectations that OPEC and its allies would agree to a production cut at a meeting later in the day.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n&gt; * Another 5.25 million workers are expected to have filed for first-time jobless claims last week, reflecting a larger swath of the country now under state stay-at-home orders. Together with the claims filed in the past two weeks, the total could now surpass 15 million. But that number is still probably millions shy of the number of workers who may have already lost their jobs as the economy abruptly shut down due to the coronavirus crisis. The unemployment claims report for last week is issued at 8:30 a.m. ET. It’s all but certain to be the third in a row showing millions of Americans filing claims for the first time. In the last two reports, a total 10 million workers had filed for state unemployment benefits.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n&gt; * Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates told CNBC he thinks schools will be able to resume in the fall but the U.S. economy won’t magically return to the way it was before. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has committed up to $100 million to respond to the coronavirus, has been working on global health issues and vaccines for years. Gates, a backer of an at-home coronavirus test, has said he would help pay for factories that can produce vaccines. During the interview, which aired Thursday on “Squawk Box,” the Microsoft co-founder suggested that therapeutic treatments for sick people could begin to roll out in four to six months, but it would take at least 18 months to develop a safe and effective vaccine to prevent the virus.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n&gt; * Global coronavirus cases increased to nearly 1.5 million with 88,981 deaths and over 300,000 recoveries, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. remains the world’s worst hot spot with more than 432,400 cases. That’s more than the combined infections of Spain, Italy and Germany. Italy still has the most deaths: 17,669. Spain said its deaths surpassed 15,000. Fatalities in the U.S. rose to 14,808. New York state’s over 151,000 cases and 6,269 deaths are the most in the U.S. Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at Wednesday’s news conference the outbreak could “stabilize” within weeks if the state maintains its strict social distancing policies.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n&gt; * Disney shares were surging over 5% in Thursday’s premarket trading after the media and theme park giant announced that its new video streaming service Disney+ now has over 50 million paid subscribers. That’s almost double what Disney reported in its first-quarter earnings in February. Disney+, which launched five months ago, was doing well even before of the coronavirus pandemic, which is keeping people stuck at home and spending more time online. Disney+ rolled out in the U.K, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria and Switzerland in the past two weeks. By comparison, it took Netflix seven years from its 2007 streaming launch to reach 50 million subscribers.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/mN5LwJi.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/59fI0g5.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/qqHptGK.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/i6noYAX.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Z0z9bsy.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\\nNONE.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\\nNONE.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/gCHn266.png)**)\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ZjD8fCP.png)**)\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/v8207Ns.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/E4pNsaE.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/HfScCNv.png)**)\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/OFGtiuq.png)**)\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/gWZvGov.png)**)\\n\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\\n\\n* USO\\n* CLVS\\n* DIS\\n* APA\\n* OXY\\n* COST\\n* PFE\\n* SBUX\\n* ATRC\\n* YELP\\n* USO\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\\n\\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-starbucks-costco-disney-anthem-more.html)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n&gt; **Starbucks (SBUX)** – Starbucks said its fiscal second-quarter profit would likely drop by 47% due to the coronavirus impact, and that it was abandoning its full-year forecast.

I am back to inform you that $ARWR is much more developed and undervalued than before. Since my previous post, they have added 2 more drugs and announced a secondary filing in December which raised them $250m in cash. I’ve been following this company for years and it’s been under constant manipulation. Institutions are acquiring shares (65% Institutional ownership) while holding price steady. ARWR is primed for its next breakout which will be incomparable to before and this is why.\\n\\n\\\\#Who are they?\\n\\nArrowhead Pharmaceuticals is a clinical stage company that is developing cures for diseases through RNA interference. In this specific mechanism a targeted gene is suppressed which affects the production of a certain protein curing the disease.\\n\\n\\\\#RNAi Worth\\n\\nTo properly evaluate Arrowhead we must first establish how much a single FDA approved RNAi drug is worth. In November of 2019, Novartis, a global healthcare company, agreed to buy Medicines Co. and its RNAi heart drug for $9.7 billion. When looking at other RNAi companies such as Alnylam we can estimate that an FDA approved RNAi drug is worth between $3-9 billion. \\\\[Novartis Deal\\\\](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-24/novartis-agrees-to-buy-medicines-co-in-6-8-billion-deal)\\n\\n\\\\#ARWR's Pipeline\\n\\nArrowhead has the best in class TRIM platform for RNAi. Currently they have 9 RNAi drugs in clinical trials with a 10th expected by the end of 2020. Of these 7 are wholly owned while two are in collaboration with Amgen and JNJ. With this stellar pipeline ARWR is only at a 2.66B market cap, extremely undervalued. \\\\[Pipeline\\\\]([https://imgur.com/a/sgBh9QU](https://imgur.com/a/sgBh9QU))\\n\\n\\\\#The Data\\n\\nArrowhead has recently released top of the line data for their Hepatitis B drug (ARO-HBV) and their cardiometabolic drugs (APOC3 &amp; ANG3). This data is extremely good and incomparable to competitors drugs showing the power of the TRIM platform. \\n\\n\\\\* ARO-APOC3 appears to be best in class by far with super efficacy even at low dose. Should get breakthrough designation by FDA for FCS and hypertriglyceridemia. IMO, considering what Novartis paid for Inclisiran, it will probably be worth $5 billion once data is reported in June/July. Please do your DD and check out eye popping top line data for ARO-APOC3. \\\\[Data\\\\](http://ir.arrowheadpharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/arrowhead-reports-interim-clinical-data-cardiometabolic)\\n\\n\\\\* ARO-HBV Hepatitis B drug which is dominating the race to a cure. \\\\[Data\\\\]([http://wap.ulabmed.com/content-134-5342-1.html.%C2%A0](http://wap.ulabmed.com/content-134-5342-1.html.%C2%A0))\\n\\n\\\\* ARO-AAT treats liver diseases and with the P2/3 data release ARWR will be worth over $100. \\\\[Data\\\\]([https://imgur.com/a/h2NWcCK](https://imgur.com/a/h2NWcCK))\\n\\nThere is no biotech that will top ARWR’s data of ARO-HBV, ARO-AAT, and ARO-APOC3. The results are just off the charts good and all are home runs. Expecting the same with ARO-HSD, ARO-HIF2 and ARO-ENaC. This is THE opportunity to BUY in my humble opinion.\\n\\n\\\\#Cash\\n\\nOne of the biggest problems for biotechs is cash. Fortunately for ARWR they had a secondary equity offering at $58 in December of 2019 raising about 250m in cash. They currently have $450m+ cash which is enough to operate through this pandemic and about 4-5 years into the future.\\n\\n\\\\#New Facility\\n\\nIn March, ARWR announced the addition of their new 21,000 sq/ft facility in San Diego. Coincidentally, Johnson and Johnson, who ARWR’s HBV drug is partnered to, have their research and development center nearby. The partnership with JNJ means they own the rights to three more ARWR RNAi indications/targets that JNJ must perform pre-clinical on. They are most likely going to perform this research in San Diego while they partner with another ARWR indication that is proven safe, effective, and already in the clinic. JNJ has already had a peak under the hood and knows what they own. It’s what we don't know that holds the greatest value. \\\\[New Facilitity\\\\](https://imgur.com/a/gZGBj5V)\\n\\n\\\\#Hiring Employees\\n\\nVery recently ARWR has been hiring tons of new employees including three new positions on their career board. All Senior Vice President of marketing/market access positions. They first bring in a head of commercialization and then begin building the professional marketing staff. The requirements include preferred experience in CV, pulmonary, oncology or rare disease. This sounds like the company’s development pipeline. Currently on ARWR’s career site there are 34 jobs, the most there’s ever been. A company would not hire for these positions if they did not have an idea how well the drugs work or are going to work. \\\\[Job Listing\\\\](https://arrowheadpharmaceuticals.applytojob.com/apply/xMRVVfW2IP/Sr-DirectorVice-President-Market-Access?referrer=20200404013706B4JSJAIWGXS3PXC2)\\n\\n\\\\#Price Target\\n\\nAs more data is released Arrowhead will only come closer to its true valuation. Functional cures will start to be announced as trials continue to progress. Biotech pharma is going to have one of the biggest rebounds of any sector. People will be more informed about viruses and take interest in investing in results. Supply chains will come home creating millions of USA jobs, FDA is getting streamlined to move rapid good results. $ARWR will be between $100-$200 by year end.\\n\\n\\\\#TLDR \\n\\nARWR goes big uppies very soon. Here is a very good report on the company that I highly recommend looking through.

       "  \"&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSome of you may remember me from [This Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dv83sb/arwr_will_be_the_next_top_pharmaceutical_company/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) where I talked about ARWR when it was sitting around $40 before it broke out and hit an ATH of $73 in the same month. I am back again to inform you that $ARWR is much more developed and undervalued than before. Since my previous post, they have added 2 more drugs and announced a secondary filing in December which raised them $250m in cash. I’ve been following this company for years and it’s been under constant manipulation. Institutions are acquiring shares (65% Institutional ownership) while holding price steady. ARWR is primed for its next breakout which will be incomparable to before and this is why.\\n\\n# Who are they?\\n\\nArrowhead Pharmaceuticals is a clinical stage company that is developing cures for diseases through RNA interference. In this specific mechanism a targeted gene is suppressed which affects the production of a certain protein curing the disease.\\n\\n# RNAi Worth\\n\\nTo properly evaluate Arrowhead we must first establish how much a single FDA approved RNAi drug is worth. In November of 2019, Novartis, a global healthcare company, agreed to buy Medicines Co. and its RNAi heart drug for $9.7 billion. When looking at other RNAi companies such as Alnylam we can estimate that an FDA approved RNAi drug is worth between $3-9 billion. [Novartis Deal](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-24/novartis-agrees-to-buy-medicines-co-in-6-8-billion-deal)\\n\\n# ARWR's Pipeline\\n\\nArrowhead has the best in class TRIM platform for RNAi. Currently they have 9 RNAi drugs in clinical trials with a 10th expected by the end of 2020. Of these 7 are wholly owned while two are in collaboration with Amgen and JNJ. With this stellar pipeline ARWR is only at a 2.66B market cap, extremely undervalued. [Pipeline](https://imgur.com/a/sgBh9QU)\\n\\n# The Data\\n\\nArrowhead has recently released top of the line data for their Hepatitis B drug (ARO-HBV) and their cardiometabolic drugs (APOC3 &amp; ANG3). This data is extremely good and incomparable to competitors drugs showing the power of the TRIM platform. \\n\\n\\\\* ARO-APOC3 appears to be best in class by far with super efficacy even at low dose. Should get breakthrough designation by FDA for FCS and hypertriglyceridemia. IMO, considering what Novartis paid for Inclisiran, it will probably be worth $5 billion once data is reported in June/July. Please do your DD and check out eye popping top line data for ARO-APOC3. [Data](http://ir.arrowheadpharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/arrowhead-reports-interim-clinical-data-cardiometabolic)\\n\\n\\\\* ARO-HBV Hepatitis B drug which is dominating the race to a cure. [Data](http://wap.ulabmed.com/content-134-5342-1.html.%C2%A0)\\n\\n\\\\* ARO-AAT treats liver diseases and with the P2/3 data release ARWR will be worth over $100. [Data](https://imgur.com/a/h2NWcCK)\\n\\nThere is no biotech that will top ARWR’s data of ARO-HBV, ARO-AAT, and ARO-APOC3. The results are just off the charts good and all are home runs. Expecting the same with ARO-HSD, ARO-HIF2 and ARO-ENaC. This is THE opportunity to BUY in my humble opinion.\\n\\n# Cash\\n\\nOne of the biggest problems for biotechs is cash. Fortunately for ARWR they had a secondary equity offering at $58 in December of 2019 raising about 250m in cash. They currently have $450m+ cash which is enough to operate through this pandemic and about 4-5 years into the future.\\n\\n# New Facility\\n\\nIn March, ARWR announced the addition of their new 21,000 sq/ft facility in San Diego. Coincidentally, Johnson and Johnson, who ARWR’s HBV drug is partnered to, have their research and development center nearby. The partnership with JNJ means they own the rights to three more ARWR RNAi indications/targets that JNJ must perform pre-clinical on. They are most likely going to perform this research in San Diego while they partner with another ARWR indication that is proven safe, effective, and already in the clinic. JNJ has already had a peak under the hood and knows what they own. It’s what we don't know that holds the greatest value. [New Facility](https://imgur.com/a/gZGBj5V)\\n\\n# Hiring Employees\\n\\nVery recently ARWR has been hiring tons of new employees including three new positions on their career board. All Senior Vice President of marketing/market access positions. They first bring in a head of commercialization and then begin building the professional marketing staff. The requirements include preferred experience in CV, pulmonary, oncology or rare disease. This sounds like the company’s development pipeline. Currently on ARWR’s career site there are 34 jobs, the most there’s ever been. A company would not hire for these positions if they did not have an idea how well the drugs work or are going to work. [Job](https://arrowheadpharmaceuticals.applytojob.com/apply/xMRVVfW2IP/Sr-DirectorVice-President-Market-Access?referrer=20200404013706B4JSJAIWGXS3PXC2)\\n\\n# Price Target\\n\\nAs more data is released Arrowhead will only come closer to its true valuation. Functional cures will start to be announced as trials continue to progress. Biotech pharma is going to have one of the biggest rebounds of any sector. People will be more informed about viruses and take interest in investing in results. Supply chains will come home creating millions of USA jobs, FDA is getting streamlined to move rapid good results. $ARWR will be between $100-$200 by year end.\\n\\n# TLDR \\n\\nARWR goes big uppies very soon. Here is a very good report on the company that I highly recommend looking through. It talks about all the drugs, clinical studies, and future expectations. [Read](https://arrowheadpharma.gcs-web.com/static-files/b033c528-1e07-42e2-ba7f-30136d96f2a7) By year end ARWR will have 10 products in trials as they have stated. Every single one of these drugs has billion dollar sales potential and possibly much more than that. ARWR has also mentioned that they see 20 drugs in trials in the not too distant future. This is in an incredible company that is worth much more than $3billion and as time goes on this gold mine will slowly be discovered. \\n\\n**To include most data releases and based on price targets I would recommend calls**   \\n\\n**June 19 $50 &amp; $60**       \\n\\n**Jan 15, 2021 $105**\"],\n",

You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, this is organized from most important at the top to least important at the bottom. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.\\n\\nDISCLAIMER; I am not personally advocating for any play that I add to this list. I merely go through a couple of days of posts and find what I think is competent DD. PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK.\\n\\nThis market is unprecedented. Everyone is unsure right now. Puts, calls, shares, who the fuck knows? The one thing that I am sure of is that we are not done. Many things are priced in already, that's why options are so fucking expensive right now.[ We all think](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwdmda/do_those_options_you_are_looking_to_buy_seem/) the market is gonna have some crazy swings so we want to bet on those swings. The IV is crazy and is gonna stay like that until either Beer Flu is contained or the Fed throws in the towel and lets us collapse. As the spread evens out a little bit in the coming days we have to make informed decisions about what we are gonna buy and why. Reading two sentences about some random ticker you've never heard about is not enough to make an informed decision. So that brings me to my point;\\n\\nANOTHER DROP IS COMING. It may not be in a week though. I am of the belief that there will be one or two days where we drop a lot then it'll be a steady decline until jobs come back and WuFlu is dead. The V-shaped recovery that the Trump Administration is preaching can not happen when millions of people are unemployed. It's just not possible. The US is not gonna be good. Sure social media is all talking about how they are inside but if you've been out of your house in the last week then you know that no one is taking this quarantine seriously. Keep in mind though that cases were priced in. A recession because of job loss, company failure, and market collapse is not priced in. The market WILL GO DOWN. It's just a matter of when. To combat this time scale you have to buy puts or calls months out. This short shit is tough to call.[ This poster](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fx9y9b/im_down_550k_on_my_puts_heres_why_im_not_worried/) goes into great detail about why we are going down and why he isn't worried about the loss he has suffered because of these green days.[ Europe still](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwkwf7/france_has_not_yet_reached_the_peak_of_the/) hasn't hit peak infections and will not for a while just like us (Spain (EWP) and France (EWQ) anyone?). The[ overwhelming consensus](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwmcjf/the_drop_is_coming_but_it_may_be_further_out_than/) is that we are not done falling.\\n\\nNow to plays; Mr. Fuzzy Blankeet did[ another stock analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fx6b0t/playtimes_over_fuzzy_does_db/) this time on Dave and Busters (PLAY). There are using a risky strategy to get their debt paid on time. This can be an ideal time to invest given the drop across the board. They are not making revenue right now and they released a statement recently stating that they have no idea when they will start making money again because they can't predict the economic and social impact of the virus. They are in negotiations to handle their leases and talking with investors to handle their debt. They have 18 months to get almost $800 million together to pay off their debts so they are looking to do a PIPE (public investment in private equity) which, as said earlier, is risky. Short term; expect a drop especially when earnings come out. Long term; they will probably go up. Watch the news and if they find an investor to get the debt paid that'll make their price jump.\\n\\nHonestly, there hasn't been much good DD in the last few days with the coup in the mod booth and all. The only other one I have is[ this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fx75y3/evercore_evr_will_moon_over_the_next_6_months/) about Evercore (EVR) where OP said it was gonna moon. they are an investment bank that has some decent numbers relative to their competitors. OP says up, I say watch it but it's not a huge deal. If you have money to spend buy a call. If you don't then don't waste your money on this.\\n\\nThat's it for today, just want to say congrats to the mods for the revolution. I'm glad you guys are getting this place under control.\\n\\nGood luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!\\n\\nTLDR; Drop coming probably over a long period of time, options are expensive so watch IV and don't fuck yourself with stupid moves, Dave and Busters could be fun to play, we need more DD that is actually decent here.\\n\\nPlays; Possibly puts on EWQ and EWP, Short term puts and long term calls on PLAY, maybe check out EVR but take it with a grain of salt.\\n\\nPrevious WSB DD Summaries;[ 3/26-3/27](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fq231l/wsb_dd_summary_326327_plays_and_tldr_included/),[ 3/28-3/30](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fruu30/i_compiled_dd_from_the_last_few_days_for_you/),[ 4/3-4/6](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fw4nmv/wsb_dd_summary_4346_i_hope_you_fucks_can_read/)\"],\n",

I was thinking we might see a response this weekend, so there is still time, but I think they will go forward with it on ER day. \\n\\nIn my opinion, this is an only win situation unless by for some absolutely ridiculous reason HP sticks to their guns and denies the bid. But I think there are two scenarios that will most likely occur. HP will miss on ER and announce the Xerox buyout, pretty much saving any shorts. OR HP beats ER and the stock pushes to 22-23 but there is still the issue of addressing the Xerox bid, they can't escape it, and according to Xerox, HP shareholders will benefit from the buyout, pushing the stock maybe even to 24-25 if they beat and they agree to the acquisition. \\n\\nEither way, I don't think HP will holdout, I think this thing gets announced this week and I think it's a definite win for call buyers. I've also been seeing much more OI and Volume leading up to this week in HP calls. So do with this opinion what you will, but I'm buying in now while shits cheap.\"],\n",

You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, ticker is in bold on the left and what I deem \"important\" is near the top of the post. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn\\'t enough for you greedy fucks.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI have seen a lot of predictions of where the market is headed in the future. Most of them have been complete shit written by idiots that don’t even know that you can exercise an option. There have also been a few that have got me thinking. What is the most reasonable thing that will happen in the coming months? Now I’m not writing all of this myself. I am combining the thoughts of many people and my own so do not take this as the gospel. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**The Markets Future;** The most likely thing to happen is that whenever we, as a nation, reopen there will be a large rise and then a second drop once everyone realizes the destruction that shutting the economy down has caused. The reopening of everything will act as a shot of adrenaline. People will come out of their homes in droves to go to the places they loved before the pandemic. These people will be on their way to businesses that are no longer open. Half of small businesses only have enough money on hand to last 27 days in the event of no cash flow. This is in the event of them being open and paying employees so we can stretch it out a little bit but they still have to pay utilities and rent. According to these figures, most small businesses can only last, at most, around two months. As we approach the third month of shutdown we can be sure that a good portion of America\\'s small businesses will not survive. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOur small businesses make up 45% of US GDP. If even 25% of small businesses close that would translate to a loss of 2.3 trillion dollars. When people realize that the businesses they relied on are all closed, mass exodus of the stock market will ensue. People do not want to invest when they fear not being able to make their next rent payment, or God forbid their cell phone gets shut off. Humans are emotional creatures. Fear will override any sentiment pushed by the government. They can say that they are bailing out companies, forgiving debt nationwide, and giving out free blowjobs but nothing will stop a recession with small businesses shutting down nationwide. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo here is what I believe will happen. The market will continue to go up. We may not hit the highs we saw before the drop but we will get up there. It will rise because people see that the virus is slowing, we are beating it. Then we will open, and within a month we will drop and that will be the beginning of a recession. Again, do not take this as gospel. This is just what seems most likely. Calls still work and will work until a date is confirmed that we will open. Puts will work on individual companies but not market wide like they did in early March. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThis is not the type of write up I usually do but good DD was scarce this weekend. The remaining DD I have will be short but a worthwhile read. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**WING;** Wingstop is one of the few plays for this post that looks decent. Their revenue has been rising however their net profit has been declining exponentially because of growing interest on their loans which went up from 5M to 17M in two years. They only have around 74M in assets which is more than 5 times less than what they are liable for. Their only growth strategy is to open more stores, the CEO dropped 36,000 shares, and no shares have been bought by executives in the last 12 months. These figures should be enough to tell you that Wingstop will go down. The next question is when and I can not tell you that for certain. If you want to buy in now, buy long puts for next quarter (June/July). I, myself, am going to wait a couple months and watch it develop so save this post so that you\\'ll remember. [Read this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7z3qq/the_dumpster_fire_that_is_wingstop/) for more information.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**HTHT;** Huazhu is a hotel company based in China. Puts on hotels are not really a monumental discovery but something about this has caught my eye. This is a play that I am skeptical of myself but [read this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7yq8r/calling_all_autistic_investors_htht_puts/) and come to your own conclusions. I do intend to buy a few $25p 5/15 just because they are cheap and the volume is immense. It mirrors what happened with LK in a scary way. 17,000 put options at $25p 5/15 were bought on April 22 for this ticker. The post that got me interested goes into much more detail about why they are likely to sink from their price now ($30.56) to below $25 so if this peaks your interest too then I recommend reading it and deciding for yourself. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**SNAP;** There is a much better write up [right here for more information](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8zme2/lets_talk_snap/) but I will summarize it here. Snapchat is not making much on ads and the advertising industry gets fucked during an economic downturn. Their expenditures scale with the amount of users active and because of the shutdown use is up, while the ads are going to go down. The bull in me says, “Its Snapchat, it\\'ll be fine”, but the bear in me says, “Companies which derive most of their revenue from ads will do well in a downturn.” Take what you wish. I am staying out of this one as it\\'s hard to call which way it will go. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nGood luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**TLDR;** Economy open= Market down, Wingstop is a shitshow, Huazhu is sketchy, and Snapchat is a gamble. Read previous posts for more plays that are still viable and can make you money since this one was a little sparse.\\n\\n**Plays;** Watch for a confirmed open date and then buy puts, WING puts for June/July, HTHT puts at $25 for 5/15, SNAP puts maybe for late May/June.\\n\\n**Previous WSB DD Summaries;**[ 4/16-4/20](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g50ip3/dd_from_416420_dis_shop_and_bear_porn_tldr_and/), [4/21-4/22](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g68ny9/dd_from_421422_activision_tyson_square_and_gains/), [4/23-4/24](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7f1m6/dd_from_423424_live_nation_oil_starbucks_and/)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nDISCLAIMER; I am not personally advocating for any play that I add to this list.

The consensus among Wall Street analysts calls for $1.78 billion in revenue and profits of 18 cents a share.\\n\\nAMD rival’s Intel (INTC) last week reported better-than-expected March quarter results, driven by strength in both the personal-computer and cloud-server sectors. The memory-chip producer Micron Technology (MU) likewise recently reported strong results, driven by both PC and server demand.\\n\\nIn Intel’s case, investors had a mixed reaction to the news, largely because of concerns about the outlook. Intel withdrew its previous financial forecasts for the full year, citing uncertainties tied to the Covid-19 pandemic and the associated financial downturn. Intel also cautioned that tailwinds boosting sales of PCs and servers in the first quarter were likely to fade in the second half of the year, due in part to a likely slowing of corporate spending.\\n\\nOne key question will be whether AMD maintains its current forecast for revenue for the full year, which calls revenue growth of 28%-30%. The Wall Street consensus, for $8.6 billion in sales, implies growth of 27.7%, slightly below the target range\\n\\nFor the second quarter, the consensus view is that revenue will total $1.92 billion and that per-share earnings will be 21 cents.\\n\\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/amd-reports-earnings-tuesday-heres-what-to-expect-51588019021'],\n",

Congrats you played yourself. \\n\\nTLDR of that post: Im super secret messanger, China just opened factories it takes 2 months for US to open factories hur dur \\n\\nThat post is just like todays market, fake bullshit but still rising.  \\n\\nMajority of stuff is assembled in Guangzhou region where all the main factories are. Those were open since late february. China opened all factories in march even Wuhan. First week was tough as factory suppliers had problem finding workers but now its all done and dusted.\\n\\nFun fact about factories in China, lot of B class factories have trouble finding workers after chinese new year every year. Due to Chinese policy of everything having at the same region lot of chinese people relocated from different provinces to work in factory and go back for chinese new year. Problem with that is, lot of people do not come back to work. One of our supplier has this problem,for couple months after CNY their factory works on 50% capacity because 30% of workforce simply does not show up to work after CNY. \\n\\n**But now China is back to \"normal\". If we can call it that.** \\n\\nFrom my friends and suppliers that I work with around China I have this info.   \\n\\n* People are out and about going to work using public transportation\\n* People do not shop, at all. Streets are full but shops are struggling. (governments have events encouraging people to shop but not sure how succesful that is)\\n* Lot of shops still closed (probably forever), the ones that are open are open chaotically, weird hours, some do not let customers in, only thru window. Some act like there was no virus\\n* People are jumpy af when there is new case in the city, even in Beijing, city of 20mil. One case can halt part of city. \\n* Travel is still dead in major cities\\n\\nPoints above is future reality for USA. The only difference might be spending money as americans love that shit. Chinese are indebt and have no means to pay for anything with their priorities of baby / house / car in that order. \\n\\nOutside of that you cannot compare China and USA. They are living in two different worlds and their recovery will not be the same.\\n\\n**Chinese GDP is all fake.**\\n \\nQuickly explain the GDP in China. We all know GDP is measurement of the output, and its pretty flawed one. But at least western countries pretend to follow. China on other hand. Their GDP is useless. It does not say anything about economy. CCP in all their wisdom in 2010 decided that they want to double the GDP by 2020. So what happens in communist dictatorships? Chinese provinces get GDP targets. Problem is that a lot of provinces are scared shitless of CCP so they outperform the GDP target and doubling it every year so CCP is not mad at them. How they do it? By building bridges going nowhere, by building cities where no one lives. By building roads that break in 2 years so they can repair them again. Pressure is intense. To summarize, Chinese GDP is measurement of government input into the economy not output of the economy. \\n\\nMiddle class and poor people are struggling. Have multiple people who confirmed to me that all their friends started to sell their clothes they hoarded during good times to raise money which suggest squeeze on middle class. \\n\\nSo what is China planning on doing? They gonna pump that GDP to the MOOOOOOOON as they are buying record number of construction equipment \\n\\nLeaving poor people and middle class trapped in debt. They are building whole economy on debt and are going the same way as Japan. (future stagnation for 10-20-40 years)\\n\\nUSA on other hand can maybe thank their infrastructure weeks that did nothing for decades as they can use the recession and start pumping money into crumbling inrastructure that needs update which should provide healthy GDP, work for poor people and ease the burden. But still, wont be V recovery, points I mentioned above will still happen in USA. \\n\\n\\nTLDR: China is fucked. USA is less fucked.'],\n",

These three were enough to overcome the other negative data, today.\\n\\nhttps://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/\\n\\n Oil: As stated above, crude oil inventories were reduced rather than increased (as was expected). Everyone has thought, oh, Cushing, OK is out of inventory, we haven\\'t cut enough domestic production, we\\'re going to keep building stock, run out of room, and oil is going to go negative again. Well, no, physically, there has been enough inventory there and there will continue to be, but, all this is leased out already. There are still major issues regarding oil production vs. consumption and I expect the supply chain issues with oil will build into mid May. At the moment, they are breathing a sigh of relief, and moving to the next phase.\\n\\nGas: An increase in driving can already be seen, as states have begun to reopen. What had been expected, is even with an increase in driving, refineries were still producing and would have added to stores. With this in mind, I would argue gas consumption is a major indicator of a second wave, and should be a red flag for us.

Shitty companies like Wayfair have gone on exponential runs based on the market’s expectation of a continued shift in behavior. However, the market has not taken into account another sector that is due for serious growth: food wholesalers (UNFI). As Americans, we don’t just fight over toilet paper. Grocery spending was up 27% in the week ending on May 3rd. Online grocery sales have also skyrocketed and are projected to grow to 40% in 2020. The growth in online grocery sales is obviously the result of COVID with 52% of consumers polled stating that 2020 was the first time they had purchased groceries online (see the ridiculous spike in APRN.)   \\n\\nWhere does UNFI come in?\\n\\nUNFI provides its healthy, organic foods to Whole Foods which along with other grocery stores has seen insane demand. It’s very likely that even more Americans will choose healthier food options with the fear of sickness looming in the background. However, UNFI doesn’t only provide healthy, organic food options. With its acquisition of Supervalu, it also has non-organic options and has become one of the largest food distributors in America. \\n\\nDistribution\\n\\nAs a wholesaler with now more than 58 locations (the result of Supervalue acquisition), UNFI is able to reach its retail partners quickly, giving it a leg-up with other competitors who are struggling with supply chain.\\n\\nFinances\\n\\nThese guys were so excited to release their earnings result, they released a preliminary report and they crushed it. Adjusted per-share earnings are up 130% from 61 cents during the same time last year. Revenue for the quarter comes in 12% higher than the $5.96 billion reported in the fiscal third quarter of 2019. They also reported a net income of 88 million a 57% increase from the same period last year.\\n\\nRisk\\n\\nDon’t get me wrong it has spiked since the preliminary results, but is still well below its 52-week high and certainly has not seen better conditions than this for its business.\\n\\nI’ve been looking at some of the analysts who cover the stock to see what they’ve said. None of it is really relevant, Andrew Wolf of Loop Capital Markets (what a shitty name), gave UNFI a $14 dollar price target on fears that the Teamster Union was making demands regarding health benefits and were organizing a strike. There has been noise that Amazon might be pulling out of its contract with UNFI but that hasn’t materialized. That was the major reason for the sell-off.\\n\\nI guess, the biggest risk, is the market mistakenly believing that with the re-openings that people will start returning to eat in restaurants and grocery store sales will dip. I don’t really buy this. I think most consumers won’t return to restaurants very quickly and many people will continue to use online grocery delivery etc until a vaccine is created. \\n\\nI think this is a pretty common sense play. As long as the market doesn’t tank (which it probably should) we should be good. I’d go long all food wholesalers.\\n\\n6/19 20 C UNFI\\n\\n6/19 20 SPTN'],\n",

You can't exactly compare them 1:1 though. While NVAX is aiming at succeeding both in the active vaccine ingredient (NVX-CoV2373) &amp; adjuvant ( Matrix-M™) neither of which have been approved by the FDA so far, **DVAX is only focusing on it's already FDA approved adjuvant** called CpG-1018, which is used in their FDA approved Hepatitis-B vaccine and is listed on the CDC website as a novel adjuvant that's using a synthetic form of DNA that mimics bacterial and viral genetic material ([https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/adjuvants.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/adjuvants.html)).\\n\\nAn adjuvant is used to induce a stronger antibody response in a vaccinated person, the CDC puts it the following way:\\n\\n&gt;An adjuvant is an ingredient used in some vaccines that helps create a stronger immune response in people receiving the vaccine. In other words, adjuvants help vaccines work better. Some vaccines that are made from weakened or killed germs contain naturally occurring adjuvants and help the body produce a strong protective immune response. However, most  vaccines developed today include just small components of germs, such as their proteins, rather than the entire virus or bacteria. Adjuvants help the body to produce an immune response strong enough to protect the person from the disease he or she is being vaccinated against.\\n\\nCOVID-19 is most fatal among older and immunocompromised people. Now check out DVAX's findings of their already approved adjuvant ([https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308944635\\\\_Development\\\\_of\\\\_the\\\\_CpG\\\\_Adjuvant\\\\_1018\\\\_A\\\\_Case\\\\_Study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308944635_Development_of_the_CpG_Adjuvant_1018_A_Case_Study))\\n\\n&gt;Development of the CpG Adjuvant 1018: A Case Study  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Preclinical testing of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) + 1018 in comparison to HBsAg + alum demonstrated induction of substantially higher antibody titers and a **favorable safety profile for 1018**. Most importantly, clinical studies with HBsAg vaccination consistently demonstrate **more rapid induction of protective antibody titers with 1018** compared to alum in all populations studied, **including groups that are harder to immunize such as the elderly and immunocompromised individuals**.\\n\\nNow you may ask yourself, well nice but what is it good without a vaccine? Let me tell you: Partnerships &amp; Royalties\\n\\nBut first let's get the following out of the way: there are almost 8 billion people on earth, there's not a single company that will be able to meet the demand this patient population requires.\\n\\nDVAX has so far entered into the following partnerships (note the insanely tight schedule - all within less than a month indicating great interest from big names &amp; gov):\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uxf45jdi74051.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a16f24e33cc0b89e4a969285160df58347be1d2\\n\\nThe University of Queensland is missing on that screenshot, too (March 2nd).\\n\\n**Sinovac (Beijing, China)**: **Major Chinese Player** Created H1N1 (swine flu) and H5N1 (bird flu) vaccines leading entity in China for COVID-19 vaccine\\n\\n**Clover (Chengdu, China)**:  Clover Successfully Produced 2019-nCoV Subunit Vaccine Candidate and  Detected Cross-Reacting Antibodies from Sera of Multiple Infected  Patients \\n\\n**Valneva (France)**: Successfuly developped Dukoral, a vaccine against cholera \\n\\n**University of Queensland (Australia):**  Funded by the Australian Government (brrrrr money)\\n\\nThe University of Queensland’s potential COVID-19 vaccine is entering an important new phase of testing with the live coronavirus to determine how effectively it induces protection against coronavirus infection.\\n\\n**CEPI (Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation):** Recently provided $388m of funding to NVAX, which caused a big 100% moonshot *after a 500% rally* (check May 11th). DVAX next?\\n\\nIn the beginning of the year DVAX was trading between $5-7 and is now trading in the mid 5s. In the beginning of the year all the COVID-19 valuation was missing and DVAX was already then considered undervalued. DVAX is now undervalued in every imaginable aspect.\\n\\nOn Monday they've announced that one or more of their partners will start phase 1 trials using their adjuvant in July 2020, the stock went from around $4.50 to $7 and has now retraced to mid 5s. On Tuesday the volume was approx. 40 million shares, of which 60% was shorted.\\n\\nIn the weeks leading up to the news there was way above average volume in shares, meaning funds have loaded this stock on upwards momentum (it's what made me buy in the first place) and they're not in it to sell out at +30%. This will naturally take a similar path that NVAX has taken and my body is ready to feel that lambo acceleration.\\n\\nThere's a short-term caveat: In case CEPI announces funding for DVAX, this likely shoots 100-200% causing a short squeeze but there's no guarantee of that happening, but it must be considerd while evaluating your strategies.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t4mh6cv9d4051.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e6d8d27a1207dd51facc24b84fbc245f44e9f13\\n\\nAt this point short term options seem risky because the IV has gone through the roof. July or October 2020 calls might be better but personally I wouldn't buy options at this point and just go straight for the stock, or maybe allocate a smaller portion to options and a bigger to shares.\\n\\nAnd some advice: in case you're retarded like me and hold your options, make sure to roll them over to later expiries during high volatility days for maximum mid-term gainz.\\n\\nNote: this is not a solicitation to buy shit, you can't sue me for your mental retardation\\n\\nGodspeed\"],\n",

       "  \"$AMD has been a hero to many portfolios. It should continue to do so, but there are some things to keep in mind:\\n\\n$AMD might have powerful laptop CPUs, but $INTC has deals in place with current laptop manufacturers which, unfortunately for $AMD, results in top mobile graphic cards being paired with $INTC CPUs. I could not find a single laptop with an $AMD CPU supported by anything above an RTX 2060, which is the lowest of the new top-end mobile graphic chips.\\n\\n$AMD has a terrible marketing team. $AMD does not communicate with their community as well as $INTC does. $INTC is very active in the community, which helps keep $INTC a household name, something that will continue to have a negative impact on $AMD's market share. Before you blame marketing on budgetary constraints, keep in mind that good marketing doesn't have to be expensive, especially when the communities are all digitally connected.\\n\\n$AMD has incredibly low power chips, which is a huge advantage. If you haven't been keeping up with what exactly makes $AMD such a sexy stock, it's probably the fact that $AMD is making 7nm mobile chips, while their rival $INTC is still working with 14nm chips. Size matters with CPUs, and the smaller often offers significant advantages.\\n\\nThat isn't to say that $AMD is a clear winner, despite low-power options. There are still some things that $AMD CPUs fall behind on. In the past, $AMD was notorious for having much slower single-thread processing time, compared to the same price range $INTC chip. The gap is closing very rapidly, but many gamers still opt for $INTC CPUs because $AMD CPUs just don't have the same great track record with gaming performance that $INTC does. (I foresee this changing as more people use the new top end $AMD chips).\\n\\n$INTC is somewhat known for being stingy on their intellectual property, somewhat like the $DIS of chipmakers. This means that features are sometimes missing in $AMD computers. For example, Thunderbolt 3 just recently started being officially supporter by $AMD. There is a lot of back and forth between the intellectual properties of $AMD and $INTC, but things are mostly amicable. This is important to keep in mind, as it means that $AMD gaining market share won't necessarily devalue $INTC faster than they grow. \\n\\nBeyond $INTC, $AMD must also consider how viable their graphic division is. $AMD graphic cards are considered inefficient, and perform generally worse than $NVDA graphic cards. $AMD GPU drivers have a history of being buggy. Most gamer enthusiasts will opt for an $NVDA GPU over an $AMD GPU. Thus, this is a double whammy against $AMD, because the laptops that have the good $NVDA GPUs, are paired with $INTC CPUs.\\n\\nWhat this all means, is that the future success of $AMD isn't quite priced in. Fair value for $AMD is probably about $45-55 right now. We will see new releases from $AMD later in 2020, to include better laptop pairings, which could result in $AMD killing it in earnings. $AMD's GPU division needs work, but saying that $AMD GPUs are trash would be a straight up lie. \\n\\nMy positions: $57c 7/17 because I don't trust this market. My target price is $AMD $70 by Jan 2021 based on anticipation in the nerd communities for the new $AMD hardware. **Keep in mind that $AMD is trading near their peak right now** so there is downward pressure to consider.\"],\n",

This DD does not tell the whole picture and was done somewhat hastily so expect grammatical and formatting errors.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n| Company ticker and market cap | TTM EBITDA| DEBT |Cash on   hand| DEBT: EBITDA | TTM EPS | PE |\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|BUD 71B|15B|97B|7B|6|1.69|27|\\n|TAP 8.28B|1.3B|9.5B|0.66B|6.8|\\\\-0.13|0|\\n|STZ 32B|2.5B|11B|0.081B|5.5|\\\\-0.18|0|\\n|SAM 6.4B|0.2B|0.1B|0.13B|0.2|8.6|60|\\n\\n**Statistics and premises**\\n\\nI did a little DD recently on alcohol stocks. My primary concern right now with companies is debt. My assumptions are that there will be decreased consumer confidence and in turn decreased spending over this period of uncertainty. My primary focus was on Alcohol companies’ debt and their future ability to pay that off which will allow them to pivot into new market opportunities.\\n\\nOther statistical foundations that I looked at include consumer preferences, and alcohol sales during recession. Sales of alcohol were down 1.6% during 2019. This was before Covid happened. However, sales of craft beer were up 3.6% YoY and sales of import beer were up 1.8% YoY. This indicates to me that the craft beer hype is still abound. Consumers want to purchase high quality beer and spirits. ([https://www.brewersassociation.org/statistics-and-data/national-beer-stats/](https://www.brewersassociation.org/statistics-and-data/national-beer-stats/)).\\n\\nAlcohol sales thrive during a recession. A snippet from a 2011 CNN money article that highlights increased sales of alcohol during the 2008 financial crisis:\\n\\n*\"Sales expanded more than 9% in 2008, the first full year of the recession, when the average unemployment rate was 5.8%. Sales slumped dramatically the following year, but were still 1% higher, as the unemployment rate shot up to about 9.3%. In 2010, sales jumped more than 9% as unemployment grew to 9.6%.\"*\\n\\nWe are apparently seeing increased sales in the past three weeks as well, \"Total alcoholic beverages rose 35% Y/Y for the week ending May 9 to mark the third consecutive week of accelerating sales, per Nielsen data.\"\\n\\n([https://money.cnn.com/2011/06/08/news/companies/alcohol\\\\_sales/index.htm](https://money.cnn.com/2011/06/08/news/companies/alcohol_sales/index.htm))\\n\\n**BUD**\\n\\nBUD, or Budweiser, is known for their name brand. Bud light, Budweiser, bud lime etc. They also produce Michelob, rolling rock, Busch, shock top, and a dozen other names. Their portfolio includes craft beers such as Goose Island, Blue point, Elysian, and many others. BUD is the monster in the beer industry. Their market cap is 71 billion dollars, dwarfing the second largest in this list by right around 40 billion dollars. BUD also has relatively good earnings per share for the trailing twelve months at $1.60. Their earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization is also strong for the trailing twelve months at $15 billion.\\n\\nHowever, BUD, in my opinion, is over leveraged right now. Their strategic plan of acquiring dozens of breweries in the past has resulted in an accumulation of 97 billion dollars in debt. Take that in, their market cap is 71 billion dollars and they have 97 billion dollars in debt. Yes, they have over 200 billion dollars in non-cash assets; however, my premise is that companies do not want debt right now as it will inhibit their ability to be flexible with increased market and consumer volatility. BUD has a debt to EBITDA ratio of 6. Which is not good.\\n\\nA second detractor is that BUD\\'s EBITDA has decreased 6 out of the last 7 quarters on a TTM basis. BUD\\'s earnings have been down for the past two years. Slowing earnings coming into this Covid time introduces even more uncertainty.\\n\\n**TAP**\\n\\nTAP, or Molson Coors beverage, is known for Coors, killians, keystone, and blue moon. They have 21 brands of beer in north America and the UK. TAP’s market cap is 8.28 billion. TAP’s TTM EPS is -0.13. Since September of 2018, their earnings have been drilling down. Their TTM EBITDA is $1.36 billion.\\n\\nAgain, TAP is debt heavy. TAP has $9.5 billion dollars in debt and has a debt to EBITDA ratio worse than BUD at 6.8. TAP has very few reasons to buy under my assumptions. Their product is not high end except for blue moon. Their hard seltzer, Vizzt, has just rolled out and has a lot of ground to make up to catch up in market share. Keystone, Coors, and killians are not high-end products and if the trend of non-craft or import beer continues to decline, I think TAP could be the worse off in this bunch.\\n\\n**STZ**\\n\\nSTZ, also known as constellation brands, is interesting. STZ is known for Corona beer, Modello, and ballast point. Ballast point is a collection of high-end craft beers. STZ is more than just beer though. They sell high end wine and spirits as well. The list of high-end spirits and wine is long and includes Kim Crawford, Robert Mondavi, black box wines, Svedka, and dozens of other high-end products. STZ has also shown interest in the cannabis market by purchasing 38.6% of canopy growth company’s issued and outstanding shares. They have further warrants, that if exercised, would result in a 55.8% ownership of issued and outstanding shares of CGC. STZ has a market cap of $32 billion, TTM EBITDA of $2.5b, $11b in debt, debt to EBITDA of 5.5 and a TTM EPS of -0.18. STZ is also reporting in their most recent earnings report that they plan to return $4.5b to investors in the form of dividends and stock buy backs. Take that as you will.\\n\\n([https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Constellation+Brands+%28STZ%29+Exercises+Warrants+to+Acquire+Shares+in+Canopy+Growth+%28CGC%29/16822343.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Constellation+Brands+%28STZ%29+Exercises+Warrants+to+Acquire+Shares+in+Canopy+Growth+%28CGC%29/16822343.html))\\n\\nThe past two quarters for STZ have been rough in terms of EBITDA and EPS. I would need to dive deeper into the earnings report to identify why. Their YOY quarterly growth is in strong decline for the past two quarters, and like the three previously mentioned companies, in decline for the past year. Out of the three mentioned up to now I think STZ has the best outlook though. They have a diversified product line with beer, wine, and spirits, they have unique growth opportunity with CGC, and they have high end alcohol products. Also, according to STZ CEO, there is no headwind in name brand Corona with the macro events. Bill Newlands was quoted by Yahoo finance saying, “Recent data show our Corona brand is up over 20%. So very strong performance”.\\n\\n([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/corona-beer-sales-on-fire-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic-constellation-brands-ceo-171135420.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/corona-beer-sales-on-fire-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic-constellation-brands-ceo-171135420.html))\\n\\n**SAM**\\n\\nSAM, known as Boston Beer company, is the second largest craft brewer in the country and the largest publicly traded. Their products include the Samuel Adams line up of craft beers, Twisted Tea, Angry Orchard, Truly, and they recently merged with Dogfish Head. SAM has a market cap of $6.4 billion, TTM EBITDA of $0.2 billion, $0.1 billion in debt, this was zero until this last quarter, debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.2, and a TTM EPS of 8.6.\\n\\nIn four of the last six quarters SAM have had YoY quarterly growth. The quarterly EBITDA growth percentages were 50%, 91%, 16%, and 26%. STZ had only one quarter of YoY EBITDA growth @ 11%, TAP had only one quarter of YoY EBITDA growth @ 48%, BUD had only one quarter of YoY EBITDA growth in the same 6 quarters @ 4%. SAM is crushing it. They have a line up of high-quality craft beers and also have the second best selling hard seltzer in Truly. Hard seltzer sales are growing at a staggering rate. Sales of hard seltzers were up 200% the year prior to July 2019. Dollar sales of the hard seltzer category were up 334% Y/Y for the week ending May 9th 2020.\\n\\n([https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/beer-companies-stocks-best-for-hard-seltzer-boom-ubs-2019-7-1028400172](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/beer-companies-stocks-best-for-hard-seltzer-boom-ubs-2019-7-1028400172))\\n\\nBoston Beer Company is in a great situation right now. They are near debt free which will allow them to be flexible in the uncertain times, they are expanding as evidenced by merging with Dogfish, they have high quality beer, and they are one of the two key players in the hard seltzer boom. My DD leads me to the conclusion that SAM is in a great position for future growth.'],\n",

       "  \"**UNFI Food** \\n\\nCoronavirus has obviously shifted consumer behavior and the market has rewarded nearly all e-commerce companies. Shitty companies like Wayfair have gone on exponential runs based on the market’s expectation of a continued shift in behavior. However, the market has not taken into account another sector that is due for serious growth: food wholesalers (UNFI). As Americans, we don’t just fight over toilet paper. Grocery spending was up [27%](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/13/shoppers-shift-from-stockpiling-to-penny-pinching-at-the-grocery-store.html) in the week ending on May 3rd. Online grocery sales have also skyrocketed and are projected to grow to [40%](https://www.supermarketnews.com/online-retail/online-grocery-sales-grow-40-2020) in 2020. The growth in online grocery sales is obviously the result of COVID with 52% of consumers polled stating that 2020 was the first time they had purchased groceries online (see the ridiculous spike in APRN.)   \\n\\n**Where does UNFI come in?**\\n\\nUNFI provides its healthy, organic foods to Whole Foods which along with other grocery stores has seen [insane demand](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2020/04/17/coronavirus-demand-whole-foods-converts-some-stores-online-only/5141287002). It’s very likely that even more Americans will choose healthier food options with the fear of sickness looming in the background. However, UNFI doesn’t only provide healthy, organic food options. With its acquisition of Supervalu, it also has non-organic options and has become one of the largest food distributors in America. \\n\\n**Distribution**\\n\\nAs a wholesaler with now more than 58 locations (the result of Supervalue acquisition), UNFI is able to reach its retail partners quickly, giving it a leg-up from other competitors who are struggling with the supply chain.\\n\\n**Finances**\\n\\nThese guys were so excited to release their earnings result, they released a preliminary report and they crushed it. Adjusted per-share earnings are up 130% from 61 cents during the same time last year. Revenue for the quarter comes in 12% higher than the $5.96 billion reported in the fiscal third quarter of 2019. They also reported a net income of 88 million a 57% increase from the same period last year.\\n\\n**Risk**\\n\\nDon’t get me wrong it has spiked since the preliminary results, but is still well below its 52-week high and certainly has not seen better conditions than this for its business.\\n\\nI’ve been looking at some of the analysts who cover the stock to see what they’ve said. None of it is really relevant, Andrew Wolf of Loop Capital Markets (what a shitty name), gave UNFI a $14 dollar price target on fears that the Teamster Union was making demands regarding health benefits and were organizing a strike. There has been noise that Amazon might be pulling out of its contract with UNFI but that hasn’t materialized. That was the major reason for the sell-off.\\n\\nI guess, the biggest risk, is the market mistakenly believing that with the re-openings that people will start returning to eat in restaurants and grocery store sales will dip. I don’t really buy this. I think most consumers won’t return to restaurants very quickly and many people will continue to use online grocery delivery etc until a vaccine is created. \\n\\nI think this is a pretty common sense play. As long as the market doesn’t tank (which it probably should) we should be good. BJ's beat is another indication that I think we're in line for growth. I’d go long all food wholesalers.\\n\\n6/19 20 C UNFI\"],\n",

You can't exactly compare them 1:1 though. While NVAX is aiming at succeeding both in the active vaccine ingredient (NVX-CoV2373) &amp; adjuvant ( Matrix-M™) neither of which have been approved by the FDA so far, **DVAX is only focusing on it's already FDA approved adjuvant** called CpG-1018, which is used in their FDA approved Hepatitis-B vaccine and is listed on the CDC website as a novel adjuvant that's using a synthetic form of DNA that mimics bacterial and viral genetic material ([https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/adjuvants.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/adjuvants.html)).\\n\\nAn adjuvant is used to induce a stronger antibody response in a vaccinated person, the CDC puts it the following way:\\n\\n&gt;An adjuvant is an ingredient used in some vaccines that helps create a stronger immune response in people receiving the vaccine. In other words, adjuvants help vaccines work better. Some vaccines that are made from weakened or killed germs contain naturally occurring adjuvants and help the body produce a strong protective immune response. However, most  vaccines developed today include just small components of germs, such as their proteins, rather than the entire virus or bacteria. Adjuvants help the body to produce an immune response strong enough to protect the person from the disease he or she is being vaccinated against.\\n\\nCOVID-19 is most fatal among older and immunocompromised people. Now check out DVAX's findings of their already approved adjuvant ([https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308944635\\\\_Development\\\\_of\\\\_the\\\\_CpG\\\\_Adjuvant\\\\_1018\\\\_A\\\\_Case\\\\_Study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308944635_Development_of_the_CpG_Adjuvant_1018_A_Case_Study))\\n\\n&gt;Development of the CpG Adjuvant 1018: A Case Study  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Preclinical testing of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) + 1018 in comparison to HBsAg + alum demonstrated induction of substantially higher antibody titers and a **favorable safety profile for 1018**. Most importantly, clinical studies with HBsAg vaccination consistently demonstrate **more rapid induction of protective antibody titers with 1018** compared to alum in all populations studied, **including groups that are harder to immunize such as the elderly and immunocompromised individuals**.\\n\\nNow you may ask yourself, well nice but what is it good without a vaccine? Let me tell you: Partnerships &amp; Royalties\\n\\nBut first let's get the following out of the way: there are almost 8 billion people on earth, there's not a single company that will be able to meet the demand this patient population requires.\\n\\nDVAX has so far entered into the following partnerships (note the insanely tight schedule - all within less than a month indicating great interest from big names &amp; gov):\\n\\n[DVAX Partnerships](https://preview.redd.it/w7tsnuvwa5051.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db2fc189dbd935fb10f4cc8be41cb0615ff01c50)\\n\\nThe University of Queensland is missing on that screenshot, too (March 2nd).\\n\\n1.

DVAX next?\\n\\nIn the beginning of the year DVAX was trading between $5-7 and is now trading in the mid 5s. In January all the COVID-19 valuation was missing and DVAX was already then considered undervalued. DVAX is now undervalued in every imaginable aspect.\\n\\nOn Monday they've announced that one or more of their partners will start phase 1 trials using their adjuvant in July 2020, the stock went from around $4.50 to $7 and has now retraced to mid 5s. On Tuesday the volume was approx. 40 million shares, of which 60% was shorted.\\n\\nIn the weeks leading up to the news there was way above average volume in shares, meaning funds have loaded this stock on upwards momentum (it's what made me buy in the first place) and they're not in it to sell out at +30%. This will naturally take a similar path that NVAX has taken and my body is ready to feel that lambo acceleration.\\n\\nThere's a short-term caveat: In case CEPI announces funding for DVAX, this likely shoots 100-200% causing a short squeeze but there's no guarantee of that happening, but it must be considerd while evaluating your strategies.\\n\\n[Position screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/sjhattlab5051.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=194dac60997df13402875fec564d41118713796a)\\n\\nShort term options seem risky now because the IV has gone through the roof.

Conveniently (for **NFLX)**, that is exactly the one thing investors won\\'t be able to see, since **NFLX** changes its reporting structure. Formerly, **NFLX** reported its numbers as *DOMESTIC v INTERNATIONAL* \\\\- in the future there will be five world regions. While on the one hand, there is indeed more transparency, on the other hand US numbers will need to be estimated. This is important, because the US numbers indicate what **NFLX** can achieve in mature markets. \\n\\nAnyway, here is my take on UCAN (USA + Canada) subscriber numbers: **They will decrease.** I do not claim that **NFLX** users will massively switch to Disney+ or other competitors. But they don\\'t need to. The numbers will still be disastrous. **NFLX** has a churn rate of 9-10% per quarter (that is the amount of users unsubscribing). This is actually pretty good. The problem for **NFLX** lies in the new or re-subscriber numbers. Since there are competitors now, massively cheaper priced, **NFLX** will not be the first choice to subscribe to for people anymore. **DIS** has been acquiring licenses for movies and series for the past two years - and the main driver for users to decide for one service over the other is their collection of classic movies and series - not the new stuff. People want to rewatch stuff - and that is something they can hardly do on **NFLX** anymore. Also, **AMZN** or **DIS** or **AAPL** each have more to offer than \"just\" movies and series. They benefit from cross- and up-selling and are not 100% dependent on streaming revenues. Unlike **NFLX**.\\n\\n\"OK\", you might say, \"those are all assumptions\". True - but I\\'ve also got some numbers for you. Let\\'s look at **CAC** \\\\- **C**ustomer **A**cquisition **C**ost. These can be calculated by dividing gross added subscriptions by marketing spend. I\\'ve taken the numbers from the **NFLX** reports. I\\'ve assumed a churn rate of 9%. And - most importantly - I\\'ve added the **netCAC** \\\\- which uses net added subscriptions. Numbers, apart from **CAC** and **netCAC** are in thousands. Table is for the US market.  \\n\\n\\n||Q1 2018|Q2 2018|Q3 2018|Q4 2018|Q1 2019|Q2 2019|Q3 2019|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|Subscript.|55.087|55.959|56.957|58.486|60.229|60.103|60.620|\\n|Marketing|$250.719|$251.298|$210.595|$312.739|$221.046|$250.606|$211.793|\\n|Churn|4.958|5.036|5.126|5.264|5.421|5.409|5.456|\\n|Gross add|7.030|5.830|6.034|6.655|7.007|5.295|5.926|\\n|Net add|2.277|872|998|1.529|1.743|(126)|517|\\n|CAC|$35.66|$43.11|$34.90|$46.99|$31.55|$47.33|$35.74|\\n|netCAC|$110.11|$288.19|$211.02|$204.54|$126.82|($1988.94)|$409.66|\\n\\n**NFLX** business is pretty seasonal. Usually, the first quarter is the most efficient while during summer people tend to subscribe less. While the **CAC** on a quarter-to-quarter basis only increased a little, you can see massive increases in **netCAC**. In Q2 2019 Netflix was unable to sustain their paid memberships - even without any additional competition. The reason was a price increase which led to an increased churn rate, which - quoting their Q3 2019 report - has not returned yet to its original value. \\n\\nThanks to the new competitors, there is no reason at all why it should go down one bit. If anything, it will increase. If it stays at 9%, churn will be 5.456.000 lost subscriptions, at 10% 6.062.000 and at 12% 7.274.000. Now look at the gross add. In each of the quarters, gross add was less than in 2018. According to **NFLX** own forecast, we look at 61.220.000 paid subscriptions at the end of Q4, equal to 600.000 net add subscriptions. Considering Q4 2017 (1.465.000, not in table) and Q4 2018 (1.529.000) this is already pretty low. \\n\\nWe also know that according to **NFLX** own reporting, marketing spend will be more weighted towards Q4 2019 this fiscal year. Let\\'s just assume, in order to have a lower bound for our estimates, that it is just the same as in Q4 2018 - $312 million. This would mean **netCACs** of $512.23. That is a 150% increase over Q4 2018. And remember - that is the lower bound. Now we know that there are competitors, which will compete for the same ad placements, where their marketing is most efficient. Then, in general, marketing prices increase on the biggest platforms. Lastly, this extremely important quarter for **NFLX** coincides with Christmas, meaning even higher marketing cost. \\n\\nIf we assume $400 million marketing spend in the US in Q4 2019 - which in my humble opinion should be quite realistic, if not still a little bit on the lower side, **netCAC** increases up to $666.67. Per user. Now what does a user bring in revenue? According to **NFLX** itself, Q4 2019 domestic revenue is expected to be $2.455 million - that is $24.93 per user. Divide **netCAC** by this figure, you\\'ll end up with 26.7 quarters that a user needs to be subscribed to **NFLX** just to recoup his or her original marketing spend. At these marginal cost there is only one thing to conclude: **NFLX** cannot grow domestically in a sustainable way anymore. Even if we take the lower bound figure, it still takes more than 20 quarters for a user to break even. And that is only break even considering marketing. Which is a smooth transition to the next point: content.\\n\\nBy far the biggest drivers of cost for **NFLX** are content creation and license acquisition. In 2019 alone, **NFLX** is expected to spend more than $15 billion for content creation, up from $12 billion in 2018. This will be around 75% of its revenues. Add marketing, interest, technology... you won\\'t be surprised that free cashflow is a whopping -$3.5 billion. Nice. General believe is that prices for production crews, sites and actors will increase due to higher competition - but most importantly only few of those produced content pieces will become hits. Will these suffice to keep the customer base happy? Or will they subscribe for a month, binge it, and unsubscribe again? **NFLX** library will be 80% rubbish (personal opinion here), while **DIS** with its vast archive of great movies just gets you to watch Star Wars for the 69th time. In order for **NFLX** to compete with a similarly big library, they will need to produce more and more and more, which means that they cannot uphold their notion to be able to finance content creation out of their own pockets. Which brings me elegantly to debt. \\n\\nMore than $32 billion as of today. With 110 million subscribers globally, that is around $300 long-term debt per subscriber. Debt increased by nearly $7 billion from 2017 to 2018, and by another $7-8 billion from 2018 to 2019. Revenues grew by $4 billion and by $5 billion respectively. While revenues are recurring and debt is not, the question remains whether increasing interest payments will take a toll. Especially if the most profitable market stopped growing and investors see less upside in **NFLX**, interest rates for newly issued bonds will increase as well, exacerbating the cash flow situation. Interest expense in 2019 will easily exceed $600 million, that is more than 3% of revenues. \\n\\nSo where does this leave **NFLX**? The domestic US market has stopped growing, but still requires new content to be created. Marketing spend is growing massively - only to **not lose** subscribers. Can **NFLX** increase prices? Not really. Churn rate already increased reportedly - and since users have competition to switch to, this will really hit them. \\n\\n**NFLX** debt increases and will continue to do so, since developing immature markets is expensive. Interest payments will have a higher impact. Competitors enter the market with more attractive pricing and a more attractive library. And deeper pockets. **AAPL**, **AMZN** and **DIS** have cash to spare - **NFLX** doesn\\'t. The $150 billion market valuation is bound to collapse sooner rather than later. Especially since investors seem to move their money away from growth to value stocks.\\n\\nSo the question is not, whether **NFLX** will tank - but how much?'],\n",

What do my dog-level genius picks have in common?  All my favorite companies target the poor and desperate and fleece them for all they\\'re worth. So lets try to add another stock to the Duncan\\'s Amoral Index.\\n\\nAll over this big beautiful nation, renters are missing payments landlords are getting ready for some mass evictions, and soon to be retirees are seeing their retirement dreams downsized. Think that 56 year old secretary is getting hired back on after crisis? No one wants to see her 2021 Twelve Months of Puppies Calendar. [It\\'s off to early retirement for those boomers](http://vjmpublishing.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/boomerfishing-1024x520.png).  So what are they left to do? Well, these folks are falling down the housing ladder and there are quite a few steps  to hit on the way down. \\n\\nMost people will do anything to avoid being homeless, and so lots and lots of folks are likely to end up looking for housing that is available right now, for cheap. There are two solutions that exist for just those customers: Manufactured (or Mobile) Homes and Extended Stay motels. Both industries have significant profit margins, as they over-charge for comparatively little housing. Both will likely see demand increase as people default on mortgages or miss rent payments. \\n\\nSo, there are two companies we are going to look at today. The first is Equity Lifestyle Properties (ELS), the nation\\'s largest owner and operator of ~~manufactured home communities~~ trailer parks The next is Extended Stay America (STAY) a hotel chain focused exclusively on providing long term housing, often to transient or displaced workers. Which one is a better investment? Well, to see we are going to look into their 10Ks and find out\\n\\n\\n[ELS 10k](https://equitylifestyle.gcs-web.com/static-files/6057d39c-adc0-4b6e-8b29-bd68d359b7cf)\\n\\n\\n[STAY 10K](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1507563/000162828020002318/stay-20191231.htm)\\n\\nIn this post, we are going to be looking more closely at Cash Flow Statements. Now, Cash Flow statements are a little more complex than a balance sheet, but still fairly legible if you take your time. Basically, it is a measure of money going in and coming out in a given year. Some key data points to look at are the cash at the beginning and end of the year, and the cash flows from Operating, Investing, and Financing. Operating being the money being brought in or lost from operating the business. Investing activities is a look at investments the company is making/ receving returns from, and financing is taking out and paying back loans. Basically. \\n\\n\\n\\nSo, looking at STAY\\'s balance sheet on pg 82, we are seeing the company has maaaaad debts. I mean, Debt to Equity is like 4:1. That is a warning bell that this company may not be able to take on more debt to weather this short term economic storm. However, lets look at the cash flow statement on pg 86. Reading down to \"FINANCING ACTIVITIES\" we can see that STAY spent an insane 507,261 on principle payments. How did it do so, when its net cash for the year was just 400,000? Well it apparently issued even more debt, to the tune of 750,000. And this, bear in mind, was before the \\'rona! All this spending was happening amid a falling EPS and falling revenues. How is STAY going to weather the economic crisis long enough to be operational when people start getting evicted en masse? That is going to be a struggle. Frankly, if STAY needs to take on more debt to survive the \\'rona, I don\\'t see how they pay it off, even if the whole country tries to get an extended stay motel room. \\n\\n\\nNow, lets see what ELS is up to. Looking at pg F-5 of their 10K, we see a way healthier state of affairs. The company is mostly run as an REIT, so its assets are heavily concentrated in land and the improvements to said land. You might consider non-building \\'land improvements\\' to be a bullshit \\'goodwill\\' type category, but I argue that for mobile home parks adding improvements like utility hookups, internet, roads, and fencing, etc actually does add value as it turns a patch of dirt into a turnkey mobile home park. \\n\\nELS has a way better debt to equity ratio, especially considering that the vast majority of their debt is not senior notes, but are mortgage payments, backed by real assets in the form of land. Now, we scroll down to the Cash Flow Statement. Now, ELS is cash flow negative, meaning it ended 2019 with a little less cash than it started with. But looking more closely, we see that while they did do some debt-funded share buybacks/dividends, they also bought and improved a lot of new land. And, their yearly net income is rising rapidly. They have lots of room cut back new land acquisition, cut back on capital projects, and scale down dividends before they will ever need to turn to debt to sustain operations. While I don\\'t love that 315,000 line of credit they took out this year, it is pretty clear that their 443,000 net operating cash can cover down on a lot of problems. \\n\\n\\nSo, when we look it over, it is clear that a wise investor will poop in ELS every time.\\n\\n\\n** TL;DR: Poop in ELS**'],\n",

There is also April manufacturing data in durable goods Thursday and April’s consumer income and spending data Friday. While that should provide an interesting view of how sluggish activity became, the market is expected to focus more on May consumer confidence Tuesday and consumer sentiment Friday.\\n*****\\n&gt; “The backward looking data is not going to get any attention paid to it,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. “It’s going to be terrible, and that’s not going to be a surprise. Confidence has held up pretty well, all things considered. It’s the PPP and unemployment benefits. People who get some support for income seem to be pretty confident.” Congress is expected to take up changes to the Paycheck Protection Program for small business when it returns June 1.\\n*****\\n&gt; April’s economic data is expected to be about the worst of the recession, since most state shutdowns extended through a good part of the month, ahead of May reopenings. First quarter gross domestic product is expected to have declined by 4.8% when a second reading is released Wednesday, but for the second quarter, GDP is expected to decline by a median 33.1%, according to CNBC/Moody’s Analytics Rapid Update, a survey of economists.\\n*****\\n&gt; Stocks gained in the past week, though rising tensions between the U.S. and China weighed on the market Thursday and Friday and could become a bigger headwind.\\n*****\\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was heading for a weekly gain of 3%, its second weekly gain in three. A big catalyst came Monday, when Moderna disclosed positive data from a small group of patients in an early trial, but it was a wild week of trading for the company’s stock as doubts arose about its limited results. On Friday, however, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the data showed promise and he was cautiously optimistic a vaccine would be developed.\\n*****\\n&gt; Astra Zeneca’s vaccine effort got a boost this week when it received $1 billion from the U.S. Health Department’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to develop a coronavirus vaccine from the University of Oxford.\\n*****\\n&gt; With investors focused on vaccines and state reopenings, market winners were the more volatile Russell 2000, up 7.8% for the week and the Dow Transports, up nearly 9.1% as airlines and other reopening stocks rallied. Airlines were up nearly 20% on the week. After a batch of earnings reports, retailers were also higher on the week, with the SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF up 6% for the week.\\n*****\\n&gt; Retailers are again among the companies reporting earnings in the week ahead, as the first quarter reporting season winds down. Costco, Nordstrom, Ulta Beauty and Burlington Stores are some of the names reporting.\\n*****\\n&gt; Keon said he is watching the economic reopenings and says the success really depends on the behavior of individuals, and whether there’s another spike in infections.\\n*****\\n&gt; “People are still scared,” he said. “It’s the personal behavior that’s going to make a difference to economic behavior. We’ll get back to some semblance of normal. It’s going to take awhile for people to feel more confident.”\\n*****\\n&gt; He expects to see a rebound of economic activity in the second half of the year, but not a V-shaped recovery.\\n*****\\n&gt; “By the end of the year, if we don’t get a vaccine, we will have made a lot of progress on a vaccine. I’m still cautiously optimistic that the market can hang in, and maybe end the year a little bit higher,” he said.\\n*****\\n&gt; One big reopening in the week ahead will be on Tuesday when the iconic NYSE trading floor reopens.\\n*****\\n\\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/AUZd4pd.png))**\\n\\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TGBcnTP.png))**\\n\\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday\\'s close:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DjoySnm.png))**\\n\\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/yJXH3jZ.png))**\\n\\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday\\'s close:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Q0QEkmb.png))**\\n\\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/c5ZprTz.png))**\\n\\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday\\'s close:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jn7Momp.png)**\\n\\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday\\'s close:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ym1qBMT.png))**\\n\\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Mr8CSMQ.png))**\\n\\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO\\'s for this week:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FPry3Mw.png))**\\n\\n# **Friday\\'s Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/QGY45ds.png))**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/qjKjCb6.png))**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/KiRgaMa.png))**\\n\\n*****\\n\\n# Weekly Market Performance – May 22, 2020: Stocks Solid in the Midst of Health and Political Challenges\\n\\n&gt; # Equities\\n\\n&gt; US equities delivered solid returns this week. With three hours to go in the week, all three markets were up almost 3% for the week, with the best performer, once again, the technology-heavy Nasdaq. The small cap Russell 2000 Index enjoyed an impressive rally, with the index returning over 9% for the week. The mid-cap S&amp;P 400 Index also had a solid showing, returning almost 9%.\\n\\n&gt; Amid ongoing COVID-19 disruptions, rising unemployment, and risks associated with reopening the economy, US stocks continued to rebound. The rally was supported by all 50 states easing restrictions, based on improving COIVD-19 trends. Several timely indicators have pointed to a pickup in economic activity, including higher credit and debit card spending and an increase in travelers based on TSA data. Second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) could contract as much as 30% annualized, but global progress in reopening economies combined with massive stimulus measures point to a potentially strong rebound in the third and fourth quarters.\\n\\n&gt; “The S&amp;P 500 just had the second-best 40-day rally ever, with only the returns off the March 2009 lows better,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Near-term, we have some concerns of a well-deserved pullback, but historically, these huge moves have tended to resolve much higher over the ensuing 6- and 12-month periods.”\\n\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.22.20-wmp.jpg?ssl=1))**\\n\\n&gt; In a change of pace, industrials were the top-performing sector for the week, followed by the energy sector. The worst-performing sectors were healthcare and consumer staples, and they posted returns that were slightly negative for the week. Looking at style, large cap value stocks edged out large cap growth for the week.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n# Leading Indicators Signal Potential Bottom\\n\\n&gt; Leading economic indicators are signaling that the pace of economic deterioration may be slowing. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI), a composite of leading data series, fell 4.4% month over month in April. While this is an undeniably abysmal reading, it is an improvement from the -7.4% in March.\\n\\n&gt; ”The monthly LEI change tends to bottom early in a recession, and sometimes even before a recession’s official start,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Stocks are forward looking, so if investors feel confident that the economic damage will not accelerate from here, they may be more willing to put capital to work. We think today’s LEI number largely confirms April’s strong moves in the equity markets.”\\n\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Economic-news-5.22.20.png?ssl=1))**\\n\\n&gt; The performance of the 10 underlying components in the LEI does indicate some disconnect between financial markets and the real economy. The two largest positive contributors to the headline LEI number this month were stock prices and the interest rate spread, which were buoyed by a swift and robust monetary and fiscal stimulus. Meanwhile, data series related to manufacturing, unemployment, and construction hurt the index, a reflection of the damage done to the parts of the economy in which workers are unable to perform their jobs remotely.\\n\\n&gt; As local economies begin to reopen, we look for the industries disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 virus to begin to rebound. While this will likely be a bumpy process, progress will likely become evident in future LEI releases and confirm that the worst of the economic declines are behind us. We think this should pave the way for further equity gains over a long-term horizon.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n# What Happens When The Bear Ends?\\n\\n&gt; The incredible rally off the March 23 lows continues for equities, with the S&amp;P 500 Index now up more than 32% in 40 trading days. As impressive as the rally has been, we do have some near-term concerns, as we discussed in Downside Risk Remains. Higher valuations, US-/China relations, weakening technicals, and the historically troublesome summer months all could play a part in potential weakness after the record run.\\n\\n&gt; “In 40 trading days, the S&amp;P 500 gained 32%, which is second only to the 40 days off the March 2009 lows,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Looking back at history shows that after the initial surge off of bear lows, stocks tend to correct about 10%, which is something we could see this time around.”\\n\\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 rallied nearly 21% in 30 days after all major bear markets. But once those initial rallies ended, there was a correction of more than 10% on average. Bottoms are a process, and as impressive as this run has been, we think the odds are quite high for some type of pullback or correction over the coming months. Thanks to our friends at Strategas Research Partners for the data points below.\\n\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.20.20-blog-chart-2-1.png?ssl=1))**\\n\\n*****\\n\\n# Bottom Line EPS Beat Rate Below Average\\n\\n&gt; The first quarter earnings reporting period unofficially came to an end earlier this week, and it should be considered quite a success given how well the equity market performed during this time period. Since earnings season began on April 13th, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has gained more than 5%. Of course, the market\\'s performance over the last month or so has much more to do with expectations on re-opening than how companies reported in Q1, but all things considered, the sky didn\\'t fall when it came to earnings results.\\n\\n&gt; In terms of how actual earnings reports came in versus analyst expectations this past earnings season, the trend wasn\\'t all that rosy. We\\'ve been tracking \"beat rates\" for more than a decade, which measure the percentage of companies reporting stronger than expected EPS and sales numbers (relative to consensus analyst estimates). Our main \"beat rate\" trackers show beat rates on a rolling 3-month basis -- meaning it looks at all companies that have reported earnings over the last three months and tells you what percentage of them beat analyst estimates.\\n\\n&gt; Below is a snapshot of both bottom-line EPS and top-line sales beat rates over the last five years as displayed on our website at our \"Earnings Explorer\" page. Notably, bottom-line EPS beat rates have been weakening quite dramatically over the last couple of months since the COVID crisis began. Just this week, the 3-month rolling EPS beat rate dipped below its long-term average of 59.37% dating back to the year 2000.\\n\\n&gt; On the other hand, top-line sales beat rates haven\\'t taken quite the hit yet. The current sales beat rate stands at 60.67%. While sales on an absolute basis fell dramatically at the end of Q1, the fact that sales beat rates haven\\'t fallen dramatically means companies have at least managed to keep up with analyst expectations. A very weak sales beat rate would have meant companies were reporting numbers even weaker than already dour analyst expectations.\\n\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/epsbeats.png))**\\n\\n&gt; We also have a forward guidance tracker that measures the percentage of companies raising guidance versus the percentage of companies lowering guidance. When this reading turns negative, it means more companies have lowered guidance than raised guidance over the last three months. As shown below, right now our guidance spread stands at -16.08 percentage points, which is the weakest reading we\\'ve seen since early 2016.\\n\\n&gt; One thing we\\'ve seen since the COVID crisis began is that more and more companies have withdrawn guidance altogether. It\\'s hard to blame them. The ones that have issued guidance have mostly lowered expectations. While this paints a bleak picture for the future, if you look at this from a \"glass half full\" perspective, it actually leaves much more room for positive surprises down the road.\\n\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/guidance5yr.png))**\\n\\n*****\\n\\n# S&amp;P 500 Down Five Straight Day After Memorial Day\\n\\n&gt; Our office will be closed for observance of Memorial Day on Monday, May 25. U.S stock and bond markets will also be closed. As you spend some quality time off please consider taking time to commemorate those who have paid the ultimate price while serving in the U.S. military. Additionally, consider taking a moment to acknowledge first responders, nurses, doctors, law enforcement, firefighters, essential workers, scientists and everyone else that has tirelessly worked and sacrificed during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\n&gt; For decades the Stock Trader’s Almanac has been tracking and monitoring the market’s performance around holidays. The trading day after Memorial Day has a mixed record going back to 1971. Both S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have declined more often than risen on the day, but average performance is still modestly positive. Since 1986, the frequency of gains has improved, and average performance has also risen however, over the last five years S&amp;P 500 has declined. The second trading day after Memorial Day has more advances than declines, but average performance is negative for NASDAQ. The third day after appears to have the best long- and short-term record combined with solid average performance.\\n\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/17c1f2e9847dc9535fcaf9721be1fd15/cf4b21edc88189d8-06/s640x960/e768e94e9f16dd65cdae2b4f8d23f15f1b3806f5.jpg))**\\n\\n*****\\n\\n# Election-Year June: Candidate Clarity Boosts Performance\\n\\n&gt; June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 49 years as a rule ranking seventh with a 0.8% average gain, up 27 of 49 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking tenth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.\\n\\n&gt; In election years since 1950, June’s performance improves notably. June is the #5 DJIA month in election years averaging a 0.9% gain with a record of twelve advances in seventeen years. For S&amp;P 500, June is #2 with an average gain of 1.3% (14-3 record). Election-year June ranks #4 for NASDAQ and Russell 2000 with average gains of 1.6% and 1.4% respectively. This performance improvement is most likely the result of presidential candidate field being sufficiently narrowed, and the ultimate nominees being identified.\\n\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a72b7e4acd0417756738dc99296c53d9/b62a78126f7fd2f0-07/s400x600/2f93e5e52a2c425a44e8dd371d8628f5cdc01bdf.jpg))**\\n\\n*****\\n\\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\\n\\n*****\\n\\n&gt; * **$COST** \\n&gt; * **$AZO** \\n&gt; * **$DG** \\n&gt; * **$DLTR** \\n&gt; * **$CRM** \\n&gt; * **$PLAN** \\n&gt; * **$CGC** \\n&gt; * **$BNS** \\n&gt; * **$OKTA** \\n&gt; * **$NIO** \\n&gt; * **$RL** \\n&gt; * **$WDAY** \\n&gt; * **$CBL** \\n&gt; * **$MRVL** \\n&gt; * **$ESLT** \\n&gt; * **$ADSK** \\n&gt; * **$HPQ** \\n&gt; * **$MOMO** \\n&gt; * **$VEEV** \\n&gt; * **$HIBB** \\n&gt; * **$ZS** \\n&gt; * **$ULTA** \\n&gt; * **$TD** \\n&gt; * **$CSIQ** \\n&gt; * **$KEYS** \\n&gt; * **$NTNX** \\n&gt; * **$PLAB** \\n&gt; * **$BMO** \\n&gt; * **$BURL** \\n&gt; * **$RY** \\n&gt; * **$MGIC** \\n&gt; * **$BOX** \\n&gt; * **$ERJ** \\n&gt; * **$ANF** \\n&gt; * **$DELL** \\n&gt; * **$CYD** \\n&gt; * **$PLT** \\n&gt; * **$VIPS** \\n&gt; * **$COHR** \\n&gt; * **$VIOT** \\n&gt; * **$NTAP**\\n\\n*****\\n\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK\\'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Mr8CSMQ.png))**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK\\'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/vZhPWXr.png))**\\n\\n*****\\n\\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\\n\\n*****\\n\\n&gt; # ***Monday 5.25.20 Before Market Open:***\\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY\\'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\\nNONE.

       "  \"**TLDR; MDT 6/5 100c**\\n\\nSup losers.  So I've been watching MDT for a while now, and have noticed a pattern that I am now going to attempt to profit off of.  Its share price has been hovering between about $92-$102 since recovering from the COVID crash, but it always seems to meet resistance around $100.  It's had multiple instances of getting over that hump, but then immediately drops below it within the next day or two.  Reversely, when it has been in the mid to low $90 range, it always manages to sneak its way back up to get close to or surpass the $100 mark.  I don't know squat about fundamentals, trends, or the market, and I'm not going to pretend like I know the reasoning behind this suspected pattern, but I do know this:\\n\\n\\\\- I'm typing this garbage from the hospital that I work at where our patient volume has doubled over the past two weeks because our state is reopening.  This means that elective surgeries are back on the menu and people who were discouraged to come into hospitals during quarantine are starting to seek treatment. Meaning that the need for medical equipment should start to rise as patient volumes increase across hospital systems.\\n\\n\\\\-Medtronic is the world's largest medical device company.  They make seemingly everything potentially needed for patient care.  Surgical equipment, pacemakers, gauze, bandages, insulin pumps, implants (not those kind you degen), stents, ventilators, catheters, imaging systems, etc.  If you've seen it in a hospital or on Scrubs, they probably make it.\\n\\n\\\\-Although there has been a large increase in the need for ventilators world wide due to COVID-19, most of Medtronic's revenue doesn't even come from vent sales.  In 2019, only about $2.7 billion of their $30+ billion of revenue came from the division (Respiratory, Gastrointestinal, &amp; Renal) that's responsible for ventilators.  This means that regardless of ventilator sales, Medtronic should see plenty of money flowing their way for the plethora of other medical devices and equipment they produce.\\n\\n\\\\-Because MDT was down literally every day this week after starting at $99.45 on Monday (again with that $100 resistance), calls are hella cheap.  At one point yesterday, a 6/5 100c option was trading at $0.28. They started the day at $0.43 and ended the day worth $0.53, so still super cheap. I got in Friday morning, but don't think it's too late come next week to make some tendies as the share price inevitably teases the $100 point as it always does.\\n\\n\\\\-My friend has an entry level position at Medtronic and is mediocre at his job at best.

Premium corporate users? I\\'d say only partially. The majority of the new users are casual users and schools. Id suggest reading this good analysis here (skip $WORK stuff):\\n\\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4346645-slack-on-zoom-out\\n\\nZM has stated that +90,000 schools are using the software which they provide for free with no cost, and no 40 minute limit (again large free user data consumption). That means there was 35 - 56ml FREE users per day from those sources. And as we know Zoom reported 300ml daily meeting participants instead of individual users.\\n\\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21242421/zoom-300-million-users-incorrect-meeting-participants-statement\\n\\nSo as an individual user, if you were in x5 meetings in one day you account for x5 \"participations\".

I\\'d wager that the vast majority are free users.\\n\\nAgain, is increase in premium users enough to offset:\\n\\n1) incredible surge in free users hogging bandwidth\\n2) pay from the +$100M acquisition of Keybase\\n3) increase in payroll from ZM announcing they are going to hire 300-500 US based engineers (which most likely them trying to erase the China image they have)\\n4) higher allocation of profits to R&amp;D\\n\\n\\nMy prediction is that the cost of revenue metric is going to increase dramatically from last quarter.\\nhttps://last10k.com/sec-filings/zm\\n\\nI think the revenue and EPS beat slightly, but overall is a disappoinment.

I\\'m a full-time daytrader that\\'s turned 10k starting in June 2018 to as of this today, 585k equity balance, I primarily use a TA + early speculative approach and look to abuse any consistent patterns I find in the market place.   I\\'d always come lurk here for entertainment but recently I\\'ve seen a lot of good posts &amp; picks that helped me make some bank. So, I\\'m giving back to this sub (or at least will try to) by sharing some of my findings &amp; thinking. This will be a **LONG** post.\\n\\nAs you should all be familiar with by now, this earnings season has provided us with tons of opportunities to make multi-baggers, particularly in companies that has a business model/part of an industry that benefits from the pandemic. Stocks like $NFLX $AMZN $PTON $TTWO $ATVI $TWLO $W and so on have ran and exploded, although some sold off after earnings there is one thing that is consistent and that is they **ALL RAN UP HEADING INTO EARNINGS**.    \\n\\n\\nSo what is next? I\\'ve been tracking many sectors &amp; industries within the US market and I can tell you with absolutely certainty the cloud/software &amp; tech space has been absolutely popping. Names like $OKTA $DOCU have been on a tear, $CRM $ESTC $CRWD $ZS $WDAY are following. The first \"cloud type\" earnings play I remember was $DBX, I had bought some OTM calls $23 &amp; $24 a week before, then all of a sudden they went up 500% on the day of earnings , ofc the stock price did run up a lot heading into ER but that comes no where close to accounting for the spike on the calls, the real reason was an **IV premium spike** due to higher demand.     \\n\\n\\nSo I did some digging and I see that $OKTA, $WDAY $CRM are reporting earnings next week, Wed May 27 for $WDAY and 28th for $OKTA &amp; $CRM. I go to Yahoo Finance and check out the calls for all 3 stocks and I find that $OKTA\\'s IV right now is sitting on avg mid 80s [https://i.imgur.com/wzAqkAB.png](https://i.imgur.com/wzAqkAB.png)\\\\_  \\n$WDAY on avg is around 80 IV: [https://i.imgur.com/ZjPbq7C.png](https://i.imgur.com/ZjPbq7C.png)   \\n$CRM on avg is at **55 IV**: [https://i.imgur.com/QeeJjwR.png](https://i.imgur.com/QeeJjwR.png)   \\nWithout doing any further analysis yet, $CRM already became my main focus for next week, as the IV premium should spike almost certainly to upper 70+ ranges without accounting for price movement.   \\n\\n\\nNow I go to the Technical analysis (TA) side of things: $OKTA [https://i.imgur.com/sjRYo5T.png](https://i.imgur.com/sjRYo5T.png) , this a beautiful uptrend and almost a straight line up, thing to note is daily RSI is over 80, combined with already high 85 IV on calls, this is a pass for me. To be clear, I am NOT saying $OKTA calls will not go up higher, I am simply saying the risk/reward here is not enticing to me, generally I like a minimum $1:3 risk-reward ratio with good probability of success.   \\n\\n\\n$WDAY [https://i.imgur.com/g1yRPVy.png](https://i.imgur.com/g1yRPVy.png) Wonderful chart, setting up for bull break into earnings, I would want a position here too, \"problem\" is Earnings is Wed and US market opens Tuesday, so might be a problem for the PDT\\'ers out here. If IV was under 60, this definitely would\\'ve been my top pick instead. A beat/upwards momentum run here could also help $OKTA/$CRM run the following morning.   \\n\\n\\n$CRM [https://i.imgur.com/yLxomIo.png](https://i.imgur.com/yLxomIo.png) The chart is bullish &amp; clear uptrend with higher lows and higher highs as of now has yet to break the previous high to send it ballistic. This is partially the reason I believe the IV on calls are so low at 55 roughly, and If/When it does break out, the IV should catch up to it\\'s peers around the 80+ IV levels assuming the others don\\'t climb even HIGHER which very well could happen. So why $CRM on a TA basis? Because the most profitable options are before a large bull/bear break, **once it\\'s started to break out, the IV gets reflected into the option price** and it becomes more difficult to get multi-baggers with higher premiums. The best time to buy is when the stock is in a clear trend but is still trading relatively flat.   \\n\\n\\n**Tldr;** Buy $CRM calls next week b/c of dirt cheap IV, a great chart set up. Sell pre-earnings or diamond hands through them is your choice, not mine. Seriously though, it takes less than 1/10th of the time for you to read this compared to how long it took me to write. This is probably going to help you out in the long run unless you want to stick to the yolo &amp; diamond hands life.   \\n**Positions:** $CRM 180c , $185c, $200c May 29'],\n",

People seem to think because other VC solutions exist that suck and don\\'t get traction or because usage has ramped massively during COVID that for some reason is bearish. \\n\\nIn any event, here are the quick takeaways:\\n\\nMassive Q1 above anyone\\'s wildest dreams: $330M in revenue vs. $200M consensus. Note, ZM\\'s quarter ends in April that they reported. This means that some of March and all of April contributed somewhere around $130MM of revenue upside. Gee, what does that mean for a annual license/subscription business? $130MM / 6 weeks x 52 weeks = $1.2B of annualized new revenue above their trailing twelve months that has been secured. This figure excludes any customers added since 4/30 (and ZM has been the top downloaded app in May and June). \\n\\nSecond, customers greater than 10 employees grew 354% YoY (compared to 170% revenue growth). This means that the runrate of the business is substantially higher than what the quarterly revenue implies.\\n\\nThird, as of the latest quarter, ZM had 769 customers with more than $100K in revenue, an increase of 128 QoQ. In the most recent quarter, they added over 500 customers with annualized revenue runrates of over $100K. \\n\\nFourth - and one of the big underappreciated wildcards - international grew 246% YoY compared to 150% for North America. With COVID rampaging in India, LATAM, Russia, and other nations, this will provide momentum. As of now, OUS sales are only 25% of ZM\\'s revenue despite being 85% of global GDP. \\n\\nFifth - guidance - they expect Q2 to have $0.44-0.46 / share earnings. That means they are runrating at nearly $2/share. They also assume $500MM in quarterly revenue for Q2. Let\\'s take a look at that. In Q1, they expected $200M but delivered $330M based on a surge in business in the last month of the quarter due to COVID. Assuming no net new customers added in Q2 (and no churn - and new customers would more than offset churn), they should deliver $200M + ($130M x 3) = $600M in sales, again, assuming no net new business. Assuming the incremental $100M vs. guidance flows through at 60% to be safe, that\\'s another $0.20/share. Now, how many new customers would they have added? Probably a fuckload, at least another $100-$150M worth of net new business. I would apply a 60% flow through on this as well incremental to mgmt\\'s forecast. \\n\\nSo that means Q2 is likely in the range of $0.70-$1.00/share for earnings, taking FY2020 to somewhere between $2.20-$3.20/share of earnings compared to mgmt guidance of $1.50. This implies a runrate of $4.00 a share of earnings. \\n\\nSo, what\\'s that worth? What PE ratio is appropriate for a massively ramping earnings play printing cash? Apply a 70x PE ratio on $4, you get $280. Apply 100x, you get $400. Apply 50x revenue multiple like other fast growth software companies, that gets you to $400+ as well. \\n\\n\"Muh competition\" and \"muh becky will stop using it\"\\n\\nThe concern around monthly prosumers is overstated (those with employees less than 10 people) - this only accounts for 30% of their revenue in the latest quarter, compared to 20% historically. This reflects in increase of about $30-$40M. The downside from churn is much more limited than people think.\\n\\nAlright guys, load up on all your puts!

That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\\n*****\\n&gt; Stocks could be caught in a tug-of-war in the week ahead, as investors weigh the potential positives of a reopening economy against worry that the coronavirus continues to spread. \\n*****\\n&gt; In the past week, the S&amp;P 500′s sharp gains briefly drove the index into positive territory for the year, before a bruising sell-off at the end of the week. Stocks were more than 47% above the March 23 low before investors got spooked by signs the coronavirus is picking up in some areas. \\n*****\\n&gt; The Fed also dampened sentiment when it released economic forecasts Wednesday that showed a slow recovery and interest rates at zero through the end of 2022. Investors will hear more of the same when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks before Congress this Tuesday and Wednesday in his semi-annual economic testimony. He may provide more clarity on the Fed’s bond buying and other policy moves.\\n*****\\n&gt; Retail sales for May are released Tuesday, and that will be an important look at consumer spending activity. It is the most important data in the coming week, other than the weekly jobless claims report on Thursday.\\n*****\\n&gt; Stocks rose on Friday with the S&amp;P 500 up more than 1% after Thursday’s sharp sell-off that sent the index down nearly 6%. Treasury yields, which move opposite price, also moved sharply lower as investors moved to the safety of bonds. The 10-year yield was back to 0.70%,  well off the high of 0.95% in the week earlier.\\n*****\\n&gt; “We’ve been overbought for awhile and digesting gains would be natural,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\\n*****\\n&gt; Stovall said the fact that 97% of the S&amp;P 500 companies’ stocks were above their 50-day moving average this past week was a warning. The 50-day moving average is a momentum indicator, and if a stock or index rises above it, it is usually a positive, but if they all do, it’s a contrarian warning.\\n*****\\n&gt; “Historically that’s just too high ... and also the P/E on the S&amp;P was 25.1 of forward 12-months earnings, which is a 52% premium to the P/E average since 2000,” he said. The P/E, or the price-to-earnings ratio, is an important tool to value stocks, and it averages around 16.5 times.\\n*****\\n&gt; In the sell-off, stocks that would benefit from the economy’s reopening were the hardest hit. Investors had been jumping into those names, driving them higher at a dizzying pace. They were also the sectors that were last to join the rally, like banks, casinos, airlines and hotels.\\n*****\\n&gt; “Once the pullback runs its course I think investors will move back again into the sectors and subsectors that were most beaten up in the bear market,” said Stovall.  \\n*****\\n&gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com, said he lightened up his holdings earlier in the week. “There were some clues early in the week that the market was vulnerable, like when the S&amp;P closed below 3,191 on Tuesday. You had some feverish trading in some of the very speculative names,” he said.\\n*****\\n&gt; Stovall said other headwinds hang over the market, and one big one is the upcoming presidential election, which could become a bigger influence on the market. RealClearPolitics has President Donald Trump trailing former Vice President Joseph Biden by 8.1 points in the latest average of polls.\\n*****\\n&gt; “Trump’s numbers are just looking so bad, and if the Fed needs to keep interest rates at zero and we have the potential for a resurgence in Covid cases, then Trump is not going to benefit from an economic recovery, and as a result, that gives Biden a better chance of being elected,” said Stovall. “It’s not necessarily that the market dislikes Biden, but they dislike uncertainty. And a decline in equity prices would be representative of that uncertainty.”\\n*****\\n&gt; # Consumer barometer\\n&gt; Retail sales are typically a barometer for consumer spending, and when Americans were shut in their homes they did much less shopping than usual. April data showed a 16.7% drop in sales, but consumers did spend online.\\n*****\\n&gt; Economists are watching Tuesday’s report on May sales closely, particularly after the May jobs report had a large upside surprise. There were 2.5 million jobs added in May, instead of an expected loss of 8.3 million.\\n*****\\n&gt; Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said business-to-business spending data for May implies that retail sales were flat compared with April’s depressed level and could be down 22% from a year ago.\\n*****\\n&gt; Zandi used data from Cortera, which collects information on about $1.5 trillion in business-to-business spending. In an analysis of spending by retailers in May, it found there were gains from April in some categories, including furniture, gasoline stations and restaurants.\\n*****\\n&gt; “Clothing and sporting goods store sales have been crushed, and that continued in May.  Restaurants,  gasoline stations and furniture stores have been hit hard, but showed strong improvement in May. Food and health and personal care stores have done well through the crisis, but gave some of that back in May,” notes Zandi. “Online retailers, general merchandise stores (which includes WalMart and Target), and building material and garden supply stores (Home Depot and Lowes) have navigated the crisis well, and May was another solid month.”\\n*****\\n&gt; Zandi said weakness in apparel and sporting goods washed out the gains in other areas.\\n*****\\n&gt; # Fed ahead \\n&gt; Strategists said Powell did not surprise the market with his comments this past week, but his sober approach reminded investors that the Fed policy will have to be in place for a very long time to pull the economy out of its deep rut. That will keep markets on high alert during his two days of testimony.\\n*****\\n&gt; “I think the cat’s out of the bag. I don’t think he can sugarcoat it. The thing he’s got to worry about is he needs help. He needs Congress and the administration to come up with another fiscal rescue package. He can’t do it on his own,” said Zandi. “He has to keep the pressure on them and get a piece of legislation before they go on August recess.  ... He’s speaking as much to the American people as he is to the policy makers.”\\n*****\\n&gt; Zandi said the Fed has acted aggressively and swiftly to unfreeze credit markets when they locked up in March, but the economy needs more stimulus ahead of a wave of potential business defaults and with a high level of unemployment. The Fed’s balance sheet has ballooned to $7.2 trillion, and on Wednesday the central bank committed to monthly purchases of $80 billion in Treasury securities and $40 billion in mortgage securities.\\n*****\\n&gt; “I think he continues to lay the foundation for policy changes to come,”  said Zandi. “He’s strongly suggesting there’s going to be more monetary support, and that would come in the form of a few things - it would be performance dependent forward guidance. ... He’s going to make it clear until the economy is at full employment and inflation is at least at target, if not above.”\\n*****\\n&gt; Zandi said Powell may discuss yield curve controls, which would mean the Fed would set targets for interest rate levels in the Treasury market, and make purchases to influence rates. Some economists believe the Fed  will adopt that tool before the end of the year.\\n*****\\n&gt; “I think he’s going to more clearly define the amount of QE they’re doing going forward. He’ll try to preserve some optionality, but he’ll try to make it known, they’re buying a lot of bonds for a long time to come,” Zandi said.\\n*****\\n&gt; But the hearings could be more politicized, and Powell may be criticized by Congress for helping financial markets more than Main Street, said John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets. “I’d be surprised if there’s a lot new, given it comes on the heels of the FOMC meeting,” Briggs said.\\n*****\\n\\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/pw0CUi2.png))**\\n\\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/fP1CK0o.png))**\\n\\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/UO6j0gC.png))**\\n\\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/GImgVgH.png))**\\n\\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JYCJeEm.png))**\\n\\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qcLni34.png))**\\n\\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iC1YmSV.png)**\\n\\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qsph2Sm.png))**\\n\\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vM5brmK.png))**\\n\\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/LscP3vHv/ipos12.png))**\\n\\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1Y2bHjI.png))**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/hrsZdEH.png))**\\n\\n*****\\n\\n# Is This The Start Of A New Bear Market?\\n\\n&gt; “Stocks take an escalator up, but an elevator down.” — Old investment axiom\\n\\n&gt; The saying above sure happened yesterday. In the end, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell 5.9% for the worst day since March 16 and the first three-day losing streak in more than three months. What does it mean? We’ve been on record that we expect some type of well-deserved pullback or at least consolidation after the 45% bounce off of the March 23 lows and the best 50-day rally ever. Then add in the fact that June has been the worst month of the year for stocks since 2000 and some type of weakness is perfectly logical here and now.\\n\\n&gt; “In many ways, this is one of the most overbought stock markets we’ve ever seen. Now the catch to this is previous times we’ve seen major levels similar to now have been closer to the beginning of bull markets than the end of bull markets,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\\n\\n&gt; This is now one of the greatest surges off a major low ever. It is perfectly normal to see a drawdown of double digits after the initial surge weakens. This could be happening now.\\n\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\\n\\n&gt; We’ve shown that huge up months like April tend to eventually resolve higher, but some near-term weakness is possible.\\n\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\\n\\n&gt; Also, when more than 90% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are above their 50-day moving average, this shows solid longer-term results. Again, suggesting that very overbought isn’t always a bad thing.\\n\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\\n\\n&gt; There was a huge spike in stocks marking new monthly highs, again historically an overbought signal. This opens the door for some near-term weakness, but is a very positive sign longer-term.\\n\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\\n\\n&gt; Last, in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 was recently more than 13% above the 50-day moving average, one of the highest levels ever. The good news is one-year later stocks were higher every single time. Yet another clue that historically overbought isn’t always a bad thing for the bulls.\\n\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\\n\\n&gt; A record run, over-the-top excitement from small traders, the Nasdaq at 10,000, historically high multiples, and seasonality all could be a factor in why a pullback here could be perfectly normal. In fact, if you are bullish, after a 45% rally, one of the best things would be for prices to reset some here over the coming months. We would be a buyer of weakness and use it as an opportunity for longer-term price appreciation.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n# Persistent Volatility Runs Into Resistance &amp; Exuberant Sentiment\\n\\n&gt; We have all been gobsmacked by velocity and strength of this V-shaped rally off the March 23 bear market low. For the record this rally became an official Ned Davis Research defined bull market on May 26 when DJIA was up 30% from the low when it made a new recovery high after 50 calendar days (see NDR definitions below). And this was on the back of the shortest bear market on record, which lasted only 40 days. Today’s market comeuppance is an important reminder that we need to be patient with this market and heed our cautious analysis and stance.\\n\\n&gt; This is still the “Worst Six Months” and as we warned in the May Outlook when the market is down during the “Best Six Months” (November-April) as they were in 2020, the “Worst Six Months” (May-October) were down or flat 86% of the time with a median S&amp;P decline of -6.7% since 1950.\\n\\n&gt; Other seasonal indicators are also flashing the caution sign. This year’s negative January Barometer and breached December DJIA low, point to possible retests of the lows and choppy, volatile trading over the next several months. See the updated composite graph of the seasonal pattern for these 22 years since 1950 in the June Outlook.\\n\\n&gt; It appears that quite a fair amount of hope was built into the rally. Lots of hope that everything is just going back to the way it was real soon. But COVID cases are on the climb again and folks are concerned that a pause and/or reverse of reopening could delay the economic recovery and derail the bull. Up until the past few days it felt like mid-February again with the market ignoring economic and corporate data as momentum pushed everything higher.\\n\\n&gt; The jobs report was a bit unbelievable and then Fed Chairman Powell’s candor and reserved outlook at yesterday’s press conference put the fear right back into the market today. Meanwhile the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model currently estimates that 2020 Q2 GDP growth will be down -48.5%.\\n\\n&gt; Sentiment had also become rather exuberant as the Weekly CBOE Equity Only Put/Call ratio we track in the “Pulse of the Market” hit 0.43 last week – its lowest level since the week ending 4/10/2010 about three weeks before the infamous flash crash. Investor’s Intelligence Advisors Sentiment survey Bullish advisors are now up to 56.9%. Correction advisors are down to 22.5% while Bearish advisors have slipped further to 20.6%, putting us at caution levels.\\n\\n&gt; Technically, things deteriorated rapidly today. After blasting through several levels of resistance we have been tracking as shown in the chart here S&amp;P 500 stalled at 3210 and plunged 5.9% today through 3115 support/resistance and closed just below 3010 support/resistance which sits at the 2019 summer highs. The next major support level below here is 2725 right near where the 50-day moving average turned up in mid-May, which would be a 15.7% correction from the recent recovery high reached this past Monday, June 8.\\n\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7d877af1643a7342c0c8622cbc763c92/eb566818257f08b5-2b/s500x750/8228cad8989a5456266c3f0d753168c4d3c3efec.jpg))**\\n\\n&gt; Ned Davis Research bull and bear market definitions:\\n\\n&gt; A cyclical bull market requires a 30% rise in the DJIA after 50 calendar days or a 13% rise after 155 calendar days. Reversals of 30% in the Value Line Geometric Index since 1965 also qualify. A cyclical bear market requires a 30% drop in the DJIA after 50 calendar days or a 13% decline after 145 calendar days. Reversals in the Value Line Geometric Index also qualify. Bull and bear markets are measured at peak and trough dates, so both the time and price criteria must be met as of the peak and trough dates.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n# More Volatility Likely During June Options Expiration Week and Beyond\\n\\n&gt; The second Triple Witching Week (Quadruple Witching if you prefer) of the year brings on some volatile trading with losses frequently exceeding gains. NASDAQ has the weakest record on the first trading day of the week. Triple-Witching Friday is usually better, DJIA has been up ten of the last seventeen years.\\n\\n&gt; Full-week performance is choppy as well, littered with greater than 1% moves in both directions. The week after Triple-Witching Day is horrendous. This week has experienced DJIA losses in 26 of the last 30 years with an average decline of 1.07%. S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have fared slightly better during the week after over the same 30-year span, declining 0.72% and 0.23% respectively on average.\\n\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cbdc17aecf40cbf412100049a35e7f1b/4c6fa6c95e723529-93/s500x750/0bd7385e1b398b3c223892fe86cd1886d41bc9fd.jpg))**\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8de0bdcd706b729d7e5ebe8fd92670b9/4c6fa6c95e723529-e7/s500x750/fa1a12f3de57328b97c1f4f5a274d24e94fd19de.jpg))**\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/09c9ca9d3a0502b4a8d97976bd73366e/4c6fa6c95e723529-cf/s500x750/498b4d398dde04ebb764b72d962aa53378b29260.jpg))**\\n\\n*****\\n\\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\\n\\n*****\\n\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/vM5brmK.png))**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/l3jztzJ.png))**\\n\\n*****\\n\\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\\n\\n*****\\n\\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.15.20 Before Market Open:***\\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/shKM8RG.png))\\n\\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.15.20 After Market Close:*** \\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\\nNONE.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.16.20 Before Market Open:***\\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PYffarr.png))\\n\\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.16.20 After Market Close:*** \\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0uE8QeB.png))\\n\\n*****\\n\\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\\nNONE.\\n\\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.17.20 After Market Close:*** \\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/bNd3sxx.png))\\n\\n*****\\n\\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HdpyR9B.png))\\n\\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.18.20 After Market Close:*** \\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DNsufe6.png))\\n\\n*****\\n\\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.19.20 Before Market Open:*** \\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FHBG6yj.png))\\nNONE.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.19.20 After Market Close:***\\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\\nNONE.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n# Kroger Co. $32.26\\n&gt; **Kroger Co.

The risk/reward profile of these three scenarios makes me bullish on the company.

Though sometimes fully retarded and always highly dysfunctional, it always entertains. \\n\\nRegardless of what you think this place is, I would even go as far to say that with this pandemic and its collateral issues, WSB has provided a place where many go to escape reality for moment, lose money, and share in a good laugh. \\n\\nI couple months back, I noticed that there was a common theme that kept popping up in posts and continues to creep into the conversation recently: **charitable giving**. \\n\\nWhen those sweet Tendies get done printing, many of us are looking for a way to give back. Given the current level of volatility in the markets, we face unprecedented times in which to make (and lose) a fuckton of capital. (I use this term \"fuckton\" loosely as a fuckton to some is $500 and others it may be $500,000.)\\n\\nAt the same time, given the current social unrest, pandemic issues, and the state of the economy, there are also many ways to give back in meaningful ways and the act of charitable giving will become more relevant the further our society gets fucked with the beer virus.\\n\\nWithin the last four months, there have been posts like those of u/Minty_Fresh1, that discuss setting up charities and an actual GoFundMe page *Tendies for Tots* set up by u/haupt91 *(which is a fucking awesome name btw)*. There has also been an effort to do some live stream events for charity.\\n\\nWhat I am not seeing is a *permanent* vehicle for the WSB community\\'s charitable donations.\\n\\nUp until now, you either see a post like “What charity should I give to?” or posts telling autists they should give to charity. This is a good start, but perhaps there is a better way for us to give and to deploy charitable donations as a group, versus sporadically as individuals. \\n\\n**The solution?**\\n\\nWe form our own fucking non-profit 501(c)(3) charity. **We call it AUTISTS UNITED. (AU).**\\n\\n**What do those numbers mean?**\\n\\nFor the uninitiated……\\n\\nA **501**(**c**)(**3**) **organization** is a corporation, trust, unincorporated association, or other type of **organization** exempt from federal income tax under section **501**(**c**)(**3**) of Title 26 of the United States Code. It is one of the 29 types of **501**(**c**) **nonprofit organizations** in the US.\\n\\n**Purpose of 501(c)(3) organizations and Autists United.**\\n\\nCongress has long recognized the importance of charitable and philanthropic organizations. Often, these organizations work hand-in-hand with the government serving the needy, revitalizing urban areas, protecting the environment and educating the public. \\n\\nCertain organizations formed with the public good as their paramount mission can apply for 501 (c)(3) tax-exempt status. This allows them to reinvest the full amount of money it earns and raises since no tax is ever due to the IRS.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, **AU** will be a non-profit 501 (c)(3) with the mission to invest, grow, and give assets to charities or other societal causes we select for meaningful and lasting impact. \\n\\nWSB members, instead of giving randomly to charities, donate into **AU** and then recommend and/or vote on how those assets should be invested. **The contributions are tax-deductible to WSB members and the assets in AU grow tax fucking free.** \\n\\nTHE RESULT: A tax efficient way to give back with charitable funds deployed according to the desire of our merry band of misfits vs. random charitable giving. \\n\\n**How does Autists United qualify for tax exempt status?**\\n\\nWhat most clearly distinguishes 501(c)(3) charities from other nonprofits is that donations to 501(c)(3) organizations are tax-deductible to their donors.\\n\\nTo qualify for tax-exempt status, an organization must be formed and operate for the benefit of the public good. However, a large majority of the organization’s activities must always further a charitable purpose. Any activity engaged in for profit can potentially cause the organization to lose its tax-exempt status. \\n\\nThere are certain states (think DE, WI, AZ, NV – leaning to DE formation) that are more favorable for setting up a non-profit, and we would form in one of those states. \\n\\nTax exempt status is then applied for with the IRS. The IRS has streamlined the application process which would allow us to obtain status much quicker than in previous years. \\n\\n**What is the advantage of a WSB charity vs. donating to the hundreds of other charities?**\\n\\n1. **Fucking control**. Right now, you select a charity, send a portion of your Tendies, and just hope that those funds are used according to your wishes. \\n\\nWith **AU,** we would have full control over how our charitable funds are allocated and to which cause. \\n\\n2. **Avoid the Bullshit**. Many \"charities\" have alarming issues with how donor funds are ultimately allocated. By establishing our own charity, we eliminate the noise and can ensure that donor funds are properly allocated and deployed to actual charitable causes. \\n\\nSome charities are awesome, don\\'t get me wrong, but there are some bad fucking apples out there. Without getting into the many pitfalls of donating to many charities, here are a few links:\\n\\n[https://smartasset.com/mortgage/the-50-worst-charities-in-america-how-to-keep-from-being-scammed](https://smartasset.com/mortgage/the-50-worst-charities-in-america-how-to-keep-from-being-scammed)\\n\\n[https://medium.com/bestcompany/charity-scandals-the-six-ugliest-of-2016-19d3f1149a]\\n\\n3. **More focused giving**. By controlling our charitable contributions, we can be more focused on which organizations are most deserving at the time, or even which causes are most applicable depending on the current state of the country. \\n\\nTo play with this idea further: we could allocate charitable funds directly to communities of our members which many need it the most, or directly to deserving individuals or businesses. In other words, a sniper approach vs. using a shotgun. \\n\\n4. **Ability to pivot a charitable direction**. Instead of being locked in to one type of charity with your donation where the charitable mission is very niche, **AU** would be positioned to pivot to different charitable causes or specific areas of the country as the need arises.  \\n\\nI have been involved with private social clubs where this has worked very well. We could select, via voting or some other rational way, 3-4 charitable causes every quarter that we would, *en bloc*, provide contributions, or have member input on a rolling basis as to which causes are most applicable *now*. \\n\\nThere are other advantages and perks to providing large donations as a group, which I can address at a later time.\\n\\n**How the do we fund Autists United?**\\n\\nSame way as any other charity. Tax-exempt entities raise money to fund their activities in many ways. This can include soliciting donations and fundraising events (which WSB has dabbled in the past with live streaming funding of Autism Society of America). \\n\\nIn short, you give a portion of your Tendies via a donation to **AU**, and you get a tax-write off in return. **AU** can also be funded by stock donations and by it making investments via its own **stock portfolio**. \\n\\n**What the fuck did you just say about Stonks?**\\n\\nYes. While completely contrarian to WSB, the AU charity could *hold stonks as assets*. The value and appreciation of those assets can then be used for further charitable giving. \\n\\nTaking this concept even further----**AU** can hold stock in companies *to which it provides charitable contributions* provided that the contributions comply with IRS guidelines. \\n\\nIf you think this would be a conflict of interest and super fucked up, look at the Gates Foundation. They have been doing this shit for years. \\n\\nThe IRS doesn’t treat donations any differently than the profits the organization earns when making investments. As a result, the IRS does not impose income tax when a stock investment pays dividends or when it sells the stock for more than it purchased it for. \\n\\nAnd since 501(c)(3) organizations can receive donations of stock that are deductible to the donor, the tax savings to the organization are significant when it pays nothing for the stock. \\n\\nAgain, nothing novel here as most brokerages have vehicles set up for donating stock to charity. However, the difference by donating to the **AU** charity **is that we maintain control over how the charitable funds are used and deployed.** \\n\\nWe will also be in a much better position to see the impact of our charitable giving as a direct Donor - Recipient relationship is possible. AU would provide ongoing reports of activity and charitable giving to the WSB community. \\n\\nAny of you had parents who adopted a whale or a star or some shit for you when you were growing up and you got a report on it’s status every month? Like that. \\n\\n**Can I donate stocks to AU? What if the stonk is a winner?**\\n\\nGiving appreciated stock you’ve held for more than a year is better than giving cash. If you donate stonk that has increased in value since you bought it more than a year ago – and if you itemize deductions -- you can take a charitable deduction for the stonk’s fair market value on the day you give it away. \\n\\nYou’ll also avoid capital-gains taxes on the increase in value over time, which you would have had to pay if you sold the stonk then gave the charity the cash proceeds. \\n\\nYou can deduct the fair market value only if you hold the stock for more than a year before giving it away. If you’ve held it for less than a year, your deduction is limited to your cost basis -- what you paid for the stonk -- not the current value.\\n\\nBy donating stonk that has appreciated for more than a year, you are actually giving 20 percent more than if you sold the stonk and then made a cash donation. The reason is simple: avoiding capital gains taxes. The maximum federal capital gains tax rate is 20 percent on long-term holdings. \\n\\n**What if the stonk is a fucking loser?**\\n\\nIf it’s a losing stonk, it’s better to sell it and give the cash. If the stonk has lost value, it’s better to sell the stonk first and give the cash to the charity. You’ll still be able to deduct your charitable donation if you itemize, *but you’ll also be able to take a capital loss when you sell the investment*.\\n\\nIf you are concerned about capital gains in the future, a donation of some appreciated shares and then buying new shares to reset your cost basis at the current, higher price will reduce your future capital gains tax exposure if the stock continues to grow in value. \\n\\nFor stonk donations, many charities may not be able to easily accept a stonk donation. We will. \\n\\n**What the fuck is next?** \\n\\nCorporate formation, bylaws, IRS recognition of exemption for tax exempt status, state tax exemption (if required), and mission and vision statements. Treasury controls and accounting would be handled by reputable third-party firms selected by board of directors.\\n\\nDomain name is locked in for **AU**, and the toll-free telephone number **1-888-4-TENDIES** is reserved.\\n\\nI will pay for the legal fees and costs for setting this up using the proceeds I made from selling one of you retarded HTZ calls the day before the delisting news.  \\n\\n**What can I do to help?**\\n\\nWe need to set up a board of directors, as the board needs to be named for formation, so any WSB members that wish to be on the Board, just DM me. \\n\\nIt would be ideal if we have representation on the board from each geographical region in the country for balance, but this is not essential. \\n\\nWe need at least three members on the board, but the more the merrier, provided it is an odd number. In the DM, **please say a little about yourself and skill set, not just \"I\\'m in!\"**. \\n\\nTypically, IRS 501(c)(3) approval takes between 2 and 12 months, inclusive of likely written follow-up questions. Sometimes it takes a little less; sometimes a little more. \\n\\nThe goal would be to get IRS tax-exempt status ASAP, but before December 31st, so we can realize the charitable deductions on this year’s tax return. (Given the current state of IRS filings and the 10m pieces of unopened mail, this may be impossible, but at least we will be in queue.)\\n\\n**Who’s in...........?**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy positions: long on LUV, LYV, CISCO calls; fucking daily with TVIX with large margin in 30-60 seconds scalps and then not calling her back; going in on AMEX tomorrow.'],\n",

The social media platform voted most likely to disappear and almost no one would notice or care.\\n\\n-A decade of piss-poor user growth while other social media platforms exploded. TWTR began hiding stagnant engagement early last year when they stopped reporting DAU\\'s. MAU\\'s are still flat-lined and USA subs are notably pitiful.\\n\\n-Couldn\\'t monetize Vine and gave that space away to other ventures for free. Couldn\\'t monetize any major network streaming and lost bids to blue chip media for anything worth acquiring. Their market space is constantly encroached upon from below and above.\\n\\n-Inexplicably climbing back to a 1 year high as it rides the DJI while its more economy attached EPS has been going down-down-down since 2019. They\\'ll likely miss any Q2 earnings conservatively estimated above 0.06-0.08 EPS and if consensus reaches over 0.10, I\\'d be dancing with my pants off. Fewer analysts are even attempting to guess in these uncharted waters but some are anticipating a negative EPS.\\n\\n-All social media ad revs *should* take a hit in Q2 and TWTR is one of the first platforms that companies will drop their ads from when business goes south. TWTR hasn\\'t diversified their revs beyond ads and wallets were simply closed in Q2. Summer is also typically a slower time for online use and those still sheltering are burnt out on bad news.\\n\\n-TWTR withheld Q2 guidance... which is bad in itself... but still implied bleak ad revs based on their taste of Covid at the end of Q1. They know. We know. They know we know. We know they know. Everyone knows the pandemic made Q2 ad revs horrible for TWTR.\\n\\n-In typical fashion, TWTR just blasted some Icarus level \"paid sub\" hype to bolster their PPS before tragic earnings. No evidence of a single line of code written, a deployment anytime soon or any reason to think anyone will pay to zing each other. I think they oopsied and dropped it too early this time to prop the share price up all the way to Q2 reporting on 7/23.\\n\\n-We *should* see the full blunt force trauma that the pandemic has had on similar companies this earnings season. Some added misery in the form of evictions, foreclosures, bankruptcies, re-closings, re-increase in unemployment and continued civil unrest may help cool the market. Probably not. The thing to watch for is if the other ad driven social media stocks missing their targets. TWTR breaking the bad news a full week before GOOG and FB makes me wonder if they\\'ll try another pump 7/27-7/29. Conversely, I\\'m also wondering if they get a deserved downgrade next week.\\n\\n-Cons are retail stock sentiment, duped bag holders, plenty of gas in the tank, creative accounting and blatant manipulation. MM\\'s made me lmao when TWTR\\'s worthless news drop on 7/8 pushed the share price up $4+ by 1pm without leaving a gap... so that volume was loaded and ready to fire IMHO... and still think they fired too early... but that\\'s why I\\'m buying puts in the near $30\\'s instead of the teens where TWTR\\'s stock price should be based on their dog-shit fundamentals and guidance.\\n\\nNow I\\'m not gehaaay enough to go full hard-on bear against this wholly un-Keynesian freak show of a market.

My best guess made, I felt last Friday was about the closest to earnings I could safely get on the boat before missing it.\\n\\nIf TWTR earnings reality starts to bake in next week like I think it will, then that\\'s an ez 2x-3x banger. If a little luck and logic puts me in the money before earnings, then I hit the bullseye and should cash out. I might risk some cream past reporting if the EPS is over-estimated. If there\\'s a decent drop and pay day, I\\'ll honestly probably convert some gains into TWTR shares when they settle for a ride back up as we go into vaccine season.

Obviously 5G stocks have been mooning, and although TSM will not be responsible for creating the technology, they will likely be the company producing those 5G chips. On top of this, Merica’s government is paying TSM to build a $12 billion plant in Arizona. TSM produces chips for the U.S. F-35 jet. Setting up a plant in the U.S. will make it much easier for future productions of any military related needs, as they have less restrictions to worry about. \\n\\nAside from all of that, TSM has also recently agreed to the world’s largest corporate green power purchase agreement. WTF does this mean? Well this purchase gives them ownership of some of the world’s largest wind farms. Their goal is to be a 100% renewable energy operated company. Why the fuck does this matter? Besides it making this world a safer and healthier blah blah blah, it is a nice PR move. People love this kind of shit and it will definitely shed positive light into the company. More importantly, major companies such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Facebook, are part of the RE100 (Renewable Energy 100).

I\\'m literally trying to give them 50 grand today, and they can\\'t even bother to throw together an invoice.  I\\'ll explain why, but first some background on the company.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**What the hell is a FLIR?**\\n\\nFLIR sells mid-range thermal cameras.  The only place they really shine is in government contracts and the oil industry. For everything else, they\\'re either too expensive or not high enough quality.\\n\\nFor common retail, FLIR is too high tech and too expensive. For big money that needs very high tech, companies and governments don\\'t mind spending extra to get the resolution they need. So for most industries, FLIR is in a bad middle ground where they\\'re too good for most people, but not good enough for the big leagues. Gas leak detection for oil is the only industry where they\\'re the top dogs, and they also benefit from government contracts because they\\'re USA-made.\\n\\n**Why government contracts?**\\n\\nAny government business (GB) that deals with classified material is required to have tech that is US-made only (with very difficult to bypass exclusions). And most GB follow the same guidelines, even if they aren\\'t classified, because the government is inefficient and illogical. Also, GB rarely care about costs, so many of them go ahead and shoot for the highest quality US-made products, like FLIR, even if it\\'s way overkill.\\n\\n**Why oil?**\\n\\nFLIR is top-of-the-line for gas leak detection. Other brands can do it, but FLIR has the only cameras with that resolution level that are ready to go out of the box. Oil companies will gladly pay a premium to keep things simple, but only if they\\'re doing well enough to buy cameras.\\n\\nOil companies aren\\'t using these to quantify gas leaks (which are ultra-high range cameras AKA spectrometers).  Oil only wants to see if a leak is occurring so they can stop it. That can be done with a mid-range stationary camera (FLIR G300a) monitoring a broad view of the site, and then when a leak occurs, they carry in a low-range handheld camera to see exactly where the leak is coming from.\\n\\nSpeaking from experience, oil workers are generally not well educated, sometimes not even literate, and looking for gas leaks is a tedious and menial task that is usually assigned to general labor or the lowest rung of management. There is a strong need to keep it simple. For gas detection, simple means the same software with the same buttons, which means the handheld units oil uses are FLIR\\'s mid-range GF series. Is mid-range overkill? Yes, but that extra cost is a minor inconvenience compared to the major convenience of uniformity.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Does FLIR have any competition?**\\n\\nNope, not at all.  Infrared (IR) cameras are an extremely limited market with little competition.  For governments, see my reason above.  For oil, keep reading.\\n\\nFor gas detecting cameras, they have to install special filters and algorithms in the cameras. They\\'re simple IR cameras, but they have the ability to sort between heat from a specific gas(es) and heat from everything else. So just through IR, you can see a cloud of methane (for example) even if all the air around it is the same temperature. I don\\'t know exactly how this works, but it sounds like a pretty complex algorithm. The filters and algorithms are FLIR\\'s patents, so other companies would have to develop their own. Low quality camera companies either don\\'t have the means to develop this technology or can\\'t compete with FLIR, and high quality companies don\\'t have the need.\\n\\nAlso keep in mind that high-, mid-, and low-range camera production processes are so vastly different that it\\'s almost like they\\'re completely different industries. That\\'s why you see companies that primarily focus in one area (like FLIR focuses on mid-range) and avoid the other two.\\n\\n* Mid-range camera companies\\n\\nFLIR. That\\'s it. There are other companies in this category, but they use low-range cameras equipped with \"cooled\" systems.  Cooled cameras convert them to a higher range, but it also makes them double the cost of their uncooled counterparts with an additional annual maintenance cost equal to ~25% of the full camera cost.  Because they use low-range cameras as their base, cooled mid-range cameras are slightly cheaper than uncooled mid-range cameras, but not by very much, and the extra maintenance is unbelievably pricey.\\n\\nFLIR has the only uncooled mid-range thermal cameras.\\n\\n* Low-range camera companies\\n\\nSome do have the means of creating gas filters and algorithms, and I\\'m sure they would love to break into the oil industry. They haven\\'t yet because they can\\'t compete with the mid-range for 2 reasons (1) they don\\'t want to create mid-range cameras and (2) cooled mid-range cameras are too expensive over time.\\n\\nRemember that oil needs a mid-range stationary camera for that broad view.  Also remember they need all the handhelds to be from the same company to keep it simple.\\n\\nSo in order for a low-range camera company to compete with FLIR, they have to create mid-range cameras in addition to the filters and algorithms for their low-range handhelds. Jumping up to mid-range means developing basically a whole new production process, which is a huge cost- and time-consuming endeavor. I think it\\'s possible for others to step up and compete with FLIR, but it will be a 5+ year process, probably more like 10+.\\n\\n* High-range camera companies\\n\\nHigh-range allows for an even broader view, which means they\\'re in a better position to compete with the stationary cameras. However, it\\'s pretty rare to need a super zoomed out view, which means they\\'ll need to make their own mid-range cameras, with their own 5-10+ year process.\\n\\nHigh-range companies don\\'t have anything low enough for handheld use, so they\\'ll also have to develop that, which is an additional 5-10+ years (unless they only step down to mid-range and directly compete with FLIR).\\n\\nAnd just to mention it, high-range might install gas detection on their high-range cameras for more detailed quantitative analysis rather than just checking if a leak exists. But they still won\\'t do that because they aren\\'t in the ultra-high range required to compete with spectrometers. And that\\'s also basically a whole other industry that doesn\\'t have anything to do with FLIR.\\n\\n**tl;dr**\\n\\nAs the only US-made IR camera company, they have no competition for government contracts.  As the only mid-range company, plus their simple gas detection tech, they have no competition in oil either.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Will anyone ever compete with FLIR?**\\n\\nNo low- or high-range company is going to spend 5-10+ years to develop a process to support an industry that might not even exist in 20 years. It\\'s possible that other industries find a use for gas detection, but well-established companies will still be resistant to a major overhaul like that.\\n\\nMy prediction is that, *if* someone is ballsy enough to bank on continued reliance on oil, a new mid-range company will eventually pop up that actually gathers enough steam to compete. Then, either FLIR or the new company will merge with a low-range company to start providing a cheaper alternative to the mid-range handhelds. Without that competition, FLIR doesn\\'t have any incentive to make that merger because they are currently the uncontested kings of gas detection.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**No competition makes FLIR sound great.  Should I play them long?**\\n\\nHell no!  First off, gtfo of WSB with that weak ass /r/investing question.\\n\\nLittle companies can only afford low-range products, which is acceptable because low-quality is all they need. Big money needs high-quality products, and they don\\'t mind spending high-cost to buy them. FLIR makes middle-cost products (too expensive for little guys) and middle-quality products (overkill for little guys and inadequate for big guys). There just isn\\'t a place for FLIR in most industries.\\n\\nGovernment contracts don\\'t change, or take years to change a minimal amount, so that will only hold FLIR\\'s price constant.\\n\\nOil is dying.  It won\\'t be a quick death, but it will die some day.  This will make FLIR\\'s price gradually decrease.\\n\\nThe only way FLIR could be a good long term play is if they miraculously convince other industries to defy logic and buy mid-range cameras.  They have no competition in the same way that no one (except fairy queen bears) would willingly go back in time just to ride the Titanic.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Is FLIR a good short?**\\n\\nFo sho. Remember all my phone calls and emails they haven\\'t been answering?  FLIR is busting ass right now with new fever-detecting camera contracts.\\n\\n**What are FLIR\\'s big stock movers?**\\n\\nIn pre-covid times, FLIR\\'s primary price mover is from oil.  They make more gas detector sales when oil is doing well, and fewer sales when oil dumps.\\n\\nExisting government contracts aren\\'t going to change, so that won\\'t affect the stock. Their inferiority (by either price or quality) in other industries also isn\\'t changing, so that will just cause a gradual decrease if anything. The only big factor that will cause stock swings is oil...\\n\\n... except for the coronavirus.

Not only has FLIR help approval for the longest time period, they also are the only company whose cameras are entirely US-made.  Both ICI and InTouch have US-made components, but they also have foreign-made components.\\n\\nAll of this means FLIR has zero competition as an FDA-approved and US-made product, which means they have basically free reign over government contracts.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Are governments guaranteed to use FLIR?**\\n\\nNo.  Governments have attempted to use unapproved and foreign-made cameras. [RedSpeed in Miami](https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/miami-dade-purchases-unproven-redspeed-fever-cameras-11648021) was the only one I could find quickly because it\\'s hard to sort between government -mandated cameras and industry-chosen cameras, but I\\'m sure there are others.\\n\\nI did find one source recently that said several US state governments is in the process of signing contracts to install FLIR in all of their schools and government buildings.  Like an idiot, I didn\\'t save the source, and now I can\\'t find the article again, which means either I suck at Google or the article was taken down.  My hunch is that it was taken down for legal reasons since the article said the contracts were not finalized yet.  Textbook example of \"buy the rumor, sell the news.\"\\n\\n---\\n\\n**What has FLIR\\'s stock been doing?**\\n\\nDespite having minimal competition as FDA-approved and zero competition as US-made, the stock hasn\\'t moved at all.  It has simply followed SPY until about June 10 when it actually dropped a level.\\n\\nI believe the stock dropped on June 10 because people have misunderstood FLIR\\'s goal, which is to secure government contracts.  We all know they\\'re overpriced for retail, but governments don\\'t follow market logic.  The government wants US-made products, and they don\\'t care what they cost. Once those contracts have been scooped up, they\\'ll be so hard for the government to change that they will essentially be a permanent bump in FLIR\\'s value.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**What has FLIR been doing?**\\n\\nSelling off the chain.  Their sales reps have been working 80+ hour weeks since mid-March.  Any retard with a phone or email account can find that information out, but why is Amazon their only publicly confirmed new contract?  What have these sales reps been so busy with if they aren\\'t closing any sales?\\n\\nBased on the amount of time that has passed since then, I have a strong instinct telling me that most of those new sales are to government agencies, whose contracts take way longer to finalize than normal industries.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Why wasn\\'t this included in the last earnings?**\\n\\nLast earnings was late February.  FLIR\\'s CEO said the coronavirus was not a \"needle-mover\" for FLIR, which is the most common argument I\\'ve seen against FLIR.  However, that was based on FLIR\\'s talks with Amazon and other retail with no mention of government.  The CEO\\'s comment made sense because they aren\\'t going to shine in sales to retail, but they haven\\'t priced in the government contracts because late February still didn\\'t expect the US to be permanently changed by this virus.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**What\\'s going to happen next?**\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce the jump happens, it\\'s going to be higher than FLIR deserves.  The masses are still confused about what FLIR is, so they\\'re going to shoot over their market value because people will see a jump and assume FLIR has broken into the retail market.\\n\\nShort term will see an immediate drop after the spike up to correct for the fact that FLIR won\\'t do well in retail.  Then long term FLIR will hover for years, maybe with a slow and steady decline as oil demand decreases, so **FLIR is still not a good long-term play**.\\n\\nThe timing on this one is going to be critical.  Sell on the upward climb and be happy with what you make.  If you wait too long and it starts to spike down, don\\'t baghold.\\n\\n**When will the spike upwards happen?**\\n\\nNo idea.  My hope is that it happens after earnings (Aug 6 pre-market).  That will mean it catches everyone off guard, and you\\'ll have a trifecta of people buying in (1) based on new government contracts, (2) news of busy sales reps misunderstood to mean a break into retail, and (3) the assumption that FLIR had some great guidance.  2 and 3 are false hopes, so they will be quickly corrected, but we can take advantage of their misunderstanding on earnings day.  If that happens, the peak will probably happen on earnings day and be corrected on Aug 7 or even mid-day Aug 6, so definitely sell on Aug 6.\\n\\nIf there\\'s a run-up pre-earnings, I\\'m going to sell on Aug 5.  A run-up will mean news of FLIR\\'s busy sales team will finally spread enough to make it a meme stock, but the best hope for earnings day will be holding steady as the good news of government contracts will be cancelled out by crappy guidance and dashed retail dreams.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Positions**: FLIR $40c or $45c 8/21.  Lots of evidence implies FLIR is going to make a killing with government contracts, but investors are retarded and they\\'ll probably misread everything and push FLIR up higher than it deserves to go.  Sell before earnings (Aug 6 pre-market) if there is a run-up.  Hold through earnings if it stays around $40, but sell on the next spike up.'],\n",

In November of last year, they purchased Contenio Health, which specializes in healthcare data ([Link](http://contineo-health.com/))\\n* SiriusIQ ([Link](https://www.siriusiq.com/)) is the smaller of the two companies involved in this joint venture. Per Sirius\\'s LinkedIn, \" SiriusIQ focuses on next-gen AI with workflow automation that streamlines business processes, conversations, analytics and more.

This is the catalyst that you\\'re waiting for.\\n\\n**To this point, everything I\\'ve presented has been facts, the following is my speculation**:\\n\\n* Keeping in mind the purpose of CLX Health, I believe the company will store healthcare information in a cloud-based system to allow any healthcare association connected to CLX Health to pull records of patients. This is how Sirius IQ, Contineo and the healthcare portion of UST Global are connected.\\n* Because of the gag order of the LOI, there has been no public communication about this joint venture from the companies involved. I believe this has suppressed the PPS of this stock.

There is a degree of discretion.  Investopedia says:\\n\\n Like popes and Oscar winners, the components of the S&amp;P 500 are selected by committee. And, like the College of Cardinals and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences, the S&amp;P 500 committee operates within specific criteria. To qualify for the index, a company must have:\\n\\n* a [market cap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) of $8.2 billion (as of Feb. 2019 guidance)\\n* its headquarters in the U.S.\\n* the value of its market [capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalization.asp) trade annually\\n* at least a quarter-million of its [shares](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/how-can-i-buy-sp-500-fund/) trade in each of the previous six months\\n* most of its shares in the public’s hands\\n* at least a year since its [initial public offering](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp)\\n* the sum of the previous four quarters of earnings must be positive as well as the most recent quarter. \\n\\nThere are no precedents for something as big as TSLA being added, but there are some clues in how Google was added in 2006 and Yahoo before that.  GOOG was not added immediately upon meeting the criteria. Here, a rational committee member might worry about adding the stock after its historic run-up, as the volatility presents risk of a a rapid decrease in price if some kind of negative news comes out. So questions that come to mind are:\\n\\n1. How likely are the 7/22 numbers to make TSLA eligible? (Does the news of a $3000 price cut on the model Y affect this prediction?)\\n2. How likely is the S&amp;P committee to quickly act to add Tesla to the index? I see pros and cons for committee members, but some pressure to the effect of \"but how can you ignore such an important company after it meets the criteria?)\\n3. Are there catalysts on the horizon for more gains or for losses, other than the obvious question of whether the company reports a profit or loss on 7/22 and what happens on \"battery day,\" not postponed till September? \\n\\nThere are so many opportunities to give a witty response on other posts here that I am hoping for some educated opinions instead of throw-away comments.

With 13F filings starting to roll in, (These can take up to 45 days after quarter end to be filed) we should be able to start and see an early glimpse as to who is actually buying $GSX and the early indicators should be a warning sign to shorts.\\n\\nThe biggest negative change was MD Financial (literally, who?!) who liquidated all of their 28,700 shares. The biggest positive change? Mother-fucking BlackRock adding 172,845 shares to their most popular EM ETF (iShares MSCI EM ETF) and 333,969 shares across all their funds who have reported so far for Q2.\\n\\nCan the stock still get delisted? Sure, anything can happen. But early signs are showing that the recent run up has been institutional buyer driven with popular core ETFs building up positions. With this likely to continue and the 30%+ shares outstanding still short, this stock is screaming short squeeze or, at the very least, a slow and steady meltup over time. Overall, buying puts now is a very high risk/very low reward strategy and you should think twice before betting (yes BETTING) any significant amount on this.'],\n",

       "  'Not Financial Advice (NFA)\\n\\nWarning: Wall of Text. If you hate reading just skim through the bolded/italicized\\n\\nEver since I publicized my findings on DKNG, the stock has underperformed &amp; probably has fucked a lot of people here, especially given the overly bullish stance back in June. For the ADHD retards, here’s what the next wall of text is going to summarize: I believe at the **current price of \\\\~$30, the stock is oversold**.\\n\\nA tech-focused, high-growth Company that has made sports betting easy to understand with an aesthetically pleasing interface similar to how Robinhood has neatly laid out stock market gimmicks so even high-schoolers can make sense of it I believe, is underpriced at these levels.\\n\\nLet’s get into some details as to why the stock has underperformed:\\n\\nFirst off, the news slate revolving sports with the rumored delay/cancellation of the MLB season &amp; the NFL watching from the sidelines is in my view, just a part of why the stock has underperformed. We’ll revisit this later in this post, but I want to focus on the drivers of the stock’s recent underperformance, &amp; why these factors are now in the rearview mirror.\\n\\n**Part I – The Past Has Passed – SPAC-related Equity Dilution**\\n\\nHistory lesson first: DKNG went public via a SPAC merger, which has exploded in popularity recently. Anyone serious about analyzing stocks going forward needs to do their homework on this, Google is your friend.\\n\\nA feature of most SPAC merger to public listings that creates a headwind to near-term share prices are embedded equity dilution events, usually in the form of earn-outs (stock bonuses to execs, the SPAC sponsor) &amp; conversion of Warrants.\\n\\nOn 5/24, the earn-outs were triggered, adding 6m shares to the share count.\\n\\nOn 6/26, 16.3m warrants converted to DKNG, netting them \\\\~$188m of cash.\\n\\nStepping back a little, in addition to the above, on 6/18 DKNG launched a follow-on equity offering of 16M shares @ $40/Share \\\\[1\\\\], receiving $621M in proceeds.\\n\\nThe last part is tricky to understand from a dilution perspective. To simplify, historically it’s almost a coin toss whether a Company’s shares outperform on the onset of an equity offering. While issuing shares does dilute the existing shareholder base, it theoretically shouldn’t, if the proceeds from the offering are earmarked for investments/projects that yield outsized returns. This is the reality for the long term, theory for the short-term. For the short-term, the ‘reality’ isn’t that the proceeds will be used for investments/projects that yield outsized returns, it is more about how convincing management is to investors that the investments they intend to pursue with the proceeds will outweigh the dilutive effects of issuing incremental shares. That’s a mouthful, but hopefully you get what I’m trying to convey.\\n\\nAll of this stuff put together – the Company has increased its share count by \\\\~39M, but now has a whopping **\\\\~$1.4Bn of cash** \\\\[2\\\\]. More on this in the next section.\\n\\n**Part II – MLB News Should Not Fucking Matter &amp; DKNG Is Positioned As the Leading Online/Mobile Sports Platform**\\n\\nDKNG should not be so tied to MLB news or any of this shit as the ongoing success of the NBA/NHL season + Soccer in Europe has effectively created a blueprint on how to regulate player behavior so that they maintain professionalism amidst the pandemic. I’m going out on a whim here, but I truly think the MLB threatening a cancellation of the season is pure posturing to get these fuckers to behave appropriately. Maybe a ‘bubble’ is what it takes to get these players to focus on their jobs instead of going out &amp; contracting COVID, but I argue that isn’t necessarily required given Soccer in Europe. So there’s already a proven path here without the need for a bubble in Soccer, so MLB/NFL should be fine, and execs need to study how they got it done in Europe. Okay, back to some facts.\\n\\nAnecdotally, I’ve kept in touch with a handful of sports bookies from California to New York &amp; even internationally about what they’re seeing – all of them say that since the NBA season started on 7/30 &amp; since Soccer (especially the Premier League) resumed in June, along with other leagues like La Liga &amp; Serie A, they’ve seen massive increases in betting.\\n\\nThese numbers are also showing up in the official data \\\\[3\\\\]:\\n\\n* Average % increase in sports betting handle from April 2020 to June 2020 (handle is the total $ wagered in sports bets) from the states that reported up to June 2020 (NJ, PA, MS, RI, WV, IA, IN, NH) of ***+258%***!  \\n\\n   * Note: NV is left out due to the site I sourced showing a weirdly negative number – so I dug into the official filings &amp; show specifically, Sports Mobile betting growth from June since April has growing by at least ***+73%*** \\\\[4\\\\]\\n\\nREMEMBER: This is for June only! No NBA, No NHL, No MLB, just Soccer, Golf, NASCAR &amp; UFC.\\n\\nThe data clearly shows that there was a ton of pent-up sports betting demand, which leads one Wall St. analyst to think that **betting on the NBA/NHL could ABSORB the MLB’s sports betting handle** (handle = total $ size of sports bet) \\\\[5\\\\]. Remember, the MLB season is still ongoing, with games being played. The entire focus is on the Miami Marlins &amp; St. Louis Cardinals. Fucking retards.\\n\\nAdditionally, I want to remind everyone that DraftKings.com is the **#1 Fantasy sports website in the U.S.** \\\\[6\\\\]. Also, since April 2020 site visitations are up ***+86%*** \\\\[7\\\\] &amp; Google Search Trends for “Draft Kings” is up **\\\\~3x** **compared to PRE-COVID levels** \\\\[8\\\\]. What does this mean? They are piquing more people’s curiosity than prior to COVID/ongoing slate of sports.\\n\\nThis is important because remember that \\\\~$1.4Bn chest full of cash I mentioned DKNG had assembled earlier? Well, that money is being put to work &amp; results are already coming in, which is exactly what DKNG intended to do with it.\\n\\n**Part III – Legalization of Sports Betting in the U.S.**\\n\\nI could write a fucking bible on this topic alone, but for now we’ll stick to some basics. Due to COVID, it’s easy to understand that each State’s financial situation is clearly in shit. Because of this, you better believe that these guys are going to start taking a hard look at how they can extract additional tax revenues, &amp; what’s one of the easiest ways to do this? Legalization &amp; taxation of gambling.\\n\\nThe big players: CA, TX, FL &amp; NY. First, CA pushing its legislation out to 2023 was fucked up, but here’s a twist I want to add to this: Anything that has to do with gambling in CA you better believe is lobbied against by not just the Tribal casino owners in CA, but by the deep pockets of Las Vegas money. Similar thing can be said for FL, but let’s take a look at some actions by LV/nationwide gambling companies that are starting to align financial incentives with guys like DKNG.\\n\\n* MGM / GVC Holdings JV in BetMGM - $450m total invested\\n* PENN invests $163m into BS Sports\\n* Caesars has a 20% stake in William Hill plus partnership deals with The Stars Group (TSG) &amp; our winner DKNG for operating its sports books\\n\\nSo it’s safe to say going forward, nationwide legalization of sports betting will reap rewards for everyone involved, &amp; no longer be something LV money is completely focused on safeguarding.\\n\\nLet’s also not forget that DKNG didn’t become the Company they are today because of their fancy app, but because their management team has a HISTORY of navigating the U.S.’s legal framework to get what they want out of it.\\n\\n* The Crown Jewel – The Internet Gambling Prohibition &amp; Enforcement Act: I said it in a previous post, but I want to emphasize that them getting Fantasy Sports to be labeled a ‘game of skill’ by FEDERAL Law as opposed to gambling is just something for the history books. Fucking genius shit.

TransUnion, SiriusIQ and UST Global are partnering up to make a joint venture company called CLX Health LLC. CLX Health LLC is introducing an app called Healthy America™️  that is set to be announced on August 6th to the world. The media will be disclosing it at 3pm EDT on August 6th. \\n\\nWhat does it even do?\\nThis link provides all the information you need without having to read all of that down there:\\nhttps://solutions.transunion.com/healthy-america/resources/file/healthy-america-project-plan-2020.pdf\\n    \\nMessage from TransUnion on Healthy America:\\n\\nIn a world forever changed by the COVID-19 crisis, we’re committed to protecting American lives. TransUnion and its US-based healthcare technology partners have developed HealthyAmericaTM. This unique solution enables people to securely share test results, helping businesses, schools and consumers assess risks stemming from COVID-19 and interact in a safe, confident manner.\\nHealthyAmerica combines the power of TransUnion’s identity and fraud solutions, clinical data management capabilities of SiriusIQ, and business transformation assets of UST Global — together forming CLX Health, LLC. By leveraging and deploying our existing technology in a way consumers and businesses can readily adopt, it will be easier to mitigate risk in everyday interactions while maintaining individual privacy. Going forward, we expect airlines, large event organizers, restaurants and others will leverage the tool — which will easily adapt to changes in science parameters, including the evolution of a seasonal vaccine.\\n(https://solutions.transunion.com/healthy-america/?=undefined)\\n\\nWhat Healthy America is:\\n\\nCLX Health LLC, a joint venture company, has developed the HealthyAmericaTM mobile application to be deployed as a key component of the HealthyAmericaTM Solution Architecture and Database. The CLX Consortium of partner companies have come together to manage the spread of COVID-19 and other viruses by accessing real-time laboratory testing data for operational business and consumer decision support, ultimately allowing the economy to scale back up to capacity.\\nUtilizing existing technology and infrastructure critical to delivering a solution now, the CLX Consortium has network access to over 1 million physician offices, 22 largest by volume clinical laboratories, 40 major hospital systems and 20 Federally Qualified Health Clinics (FQHC) in the United States.\\nIn much the same way TSA PreCheckTM provided airline passengers with an increased level of confidence after 9/11, the HealthyAmerica application is positioned to mitigate risk of businesses and individuals. With TSA PreCheck in place, passengers returned to travel with assurance that fellow travelers had been screened and posed little to no risk. The HealthyAmerica application manages real-time and batch files of health status requests for consumers to provide businesses and facilities operational decision-making capabilities that can mitigate exposure to employees and clients.\\nLike the TSA PreCheck status, which is delivered in bulk to airlines and directly to the consumer via a Quick Response (QR) code, HealthyAmerica enables consumers to present a QR code indicating health status. With the HealthyAmerica QR code, individuals can securely gain access to government-restricted sites, such as airports and/or sporting events, as examples.\\nThe HealthyAmerica application works in the following manner, first requiring the individual consumer to register. Consumer identity is verified in combination with mobile device authentication, then the consumer selects a laboratory, schedules testing and receives validated test results—all within the application on the consumer’s verified device. The HealthyAmerica application stores diagnostic or antibodies test results received directly from an FDA-approved laboratory and generates a QR code indicating current health status.(https://www.siriusiq.com/siriusiq-introduces-clx-health-and-develops-healthyamerica-tm-as-virus-response-mobile-application/)\\nMy summary and analysis:\\n\\nOkay so this app basically gives verification to other people on whether you have Covid-19 or not wherever you go. First you start off by scheduling a testing through the app for antibodies and then you send the tests to SiriusIQ labs where they see if you have antibodies. TransUnion then verifies your identity through your social security number making sure it’s you. Then the data is stored in the app which is federally regulated and presents proof of your safety from Covid-19. You can also opt in or not for contact tracing on it to see who is infected and not. I think businesses, airports and big events like baseball games will soon require this because it‘s as simple as scanning a QR code or sending a verification online through the app to wherever you're going to check if you are safe to be there both to yourself and others. It provides a more organized and safer way to open up the country and European countries as well and yes they have been approved by the European Union on this. Anyways I think this can allow countries to  open up in a safer way then the first time they tried. This would help both the economy and stock market. This will all go down on August 6th at 3 pm (EDT) when they announce the application and the media is to announce it at that time as well.\\n \\nWho are these companies TransUnion is teaming up with?\\n\\nTransUnion- TransUnion is a global information and insights company that makes trust possible between businesses and consumers, by ensuring that each consumer is reliably and safely represented in the marketplace. They do this by having an accurate and comprehensive picture of each person. This picture is grounded in their foundation as a credit reporting agency which enables them to tap into both credit and public record data; their data fusion methodology that helps us link, match and tap into the awesome combined power of that data; and their knowledgeable and passionate team, who stewards the information with expertise, and in accordance with local legislation around the world.\\nhttps://www.transunion.com/about-us/about-transunion\\n\\nSiriusIQ- SiriusIQ provides cloud-born Master Orchestration and Automation of data to streamline business processes, conversations, analytics and more. Offering enterprise-level solutions that are faster, better and smarter, SiriusIQ integrates native Cloud Services, Human-Assisted AI, Continuous Integration Continuous Delivery of Data and Subject Matter Expert Collaboration.\\n\\nUST Global- UST Global is a technology partner dedicated to transforming businesses, communities, and the people who live within them. Operating in 25 countries, we deliver future-ready digital transformation strategy services, products, and platforms that create new possibilities and help you imagine what’s next in ﬁnancial services, healthcare, retail, manufacturing, semiconductor, and communications. But what matters most is the deep partnership we forge with you to solve the unique challenges you face today, while preparing you for tomorrow. That’s us together. That’s UST Global.\\n(https://www.ust-global.com)\\n\\nThese are obviously three reputable companies that are working together and I think this can potentially be big.

       "  \"First, this is a mid to long term play, so if you are looking for overnight money, go somewhere else to lose it.\\n\\nWhy DIS is the best pick now:\\n\\n1. If virus continues, Disney + subscription and revenue (and other streaming like Hulu and ESPN) will keep on increasing --- DIS will be viewed as a growth / tech stock.\\n2. If virus has a vaccine / treament, park / movie revenue will be back.\\n\\nSo essentially DIS is the safest play now no matter the virus outcome.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nUpcoming catalysts (from this ER call):\\n\\n1. Disney parks are net positive even at 50% capacity.\\n2. Disney has hoarded 23B cash on hands!\\n3. DIS is spending 1B to restart its movie production, and will add more contents to Disney +.\\n4. Mulan will appear on Disney + as premium access for 30 dollar.\\n5. Disney will keep expanding its streaming to more countries, and hold an investor day in next few months to update its Disney + target. (The original target is 60-80M by 2024, and they already achieved 60M now!)\\n\\nSo company is very healthy, way healthier than many expected. Bottom is bounded, while Mulan on Disney + will increase its subscription and Q3 earning significantly. We could be looking at 80M subscription, and 1-2B additional revenue / earning just from Mulan by Q3 end. More contents throughout Q3 / Q4 for DIS +, and investor day in Q4 could finally wake investors up about DIS potential.\\n\\n**If all these catalyst works, DIS price will easily recover to 150 by September, and may start to trade above 200 or so by year end.**\\n\\nWildcards:\\n\\n1. More movies (like Tenet) and future Disney movies to also appear on Disney + as premium access: CEO said Mulan on Dis + is planned as a one-time thing. But if virus continues, or Mulan doubles their earning than a traditional movie release, I am sure they will consider debut all future blockbusters on Disney +. And if Disney can convince more blockbusters to join Disney + with some revenue share? DIS to the moon.\\n2. China market. Disney is the most recognized media company in China. Despite China being strict about foreign movies, if there is one streaming company that may come to China, it will be Disney +: most of its movies were in China theaters, and Disney Shanghai is a success so far. So Disney has a perfect platform for streaming service there. Whereas Netflix may never be allowed in China market. If Disney + ever enters China, it may add 100-200M subscribers!\\n\\n**If both pan out in 1-2 years, stock has a chance for 420 by 2022.**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFinally, I know many may say it does not make sense for stock to ATH while its revenue / earning is below the previous levels --- but look at NVDA, APPL, TSLA. They all ATH, doubled, tripled. But their revenue is flat or do not increase much, and earnings is just a few cents (Yes TSLA!). Future growth is all that matters. **A company with strong moat, solid fundamental, and big growth potential, and it is at multi-year low?! Buy the dip. DIS right now is just like NVDA below 160, APPL below 200, and TSLA below 300.** All bad news are priced in. And DIS only has good news and strong catalyst going forward --- maybe a fast rise is coming, or a slow and steady rise thoughout this quarter, or stagnant for a while then rise before Mulan debuts, who knows. \\n\\n**My buying strategy: stock is a great deal now (yes even after a 10% rally the past hour). Buy and hold so long Disney + growth story is intact.** If you must, buy leap call with affordable premium. Don't buy weekly call because MM can always rape weekly holders. If you would like to try your luck on monthly calls, try September - December ones.\\n\\nPotential short-term issues: If Mulan is a flop (unlikely), or Macro somehow sucks again from now to year-end (also unlikely but possible with election coming up). Stock will be ok but option holders be aware of these situations.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy track record: I only post when I am 90% confident of my predictions. One only needs 1-2 good play a year.\\n\\n1.

TransUnion, SiriusIQ and UST Global are partnering up to make a joint venture company called CLX Health LLC. CLX Health LLC is introducing an app called Healthy America™️  that is set to be announced on August 6th to the world. The media will be disclosing it at 3pm EDT on August 6th. \\n\\nWhat does it even do?\\nThis link provides all the information you need without having to read all of that down there:\\nhttps://solutions.transunion.com/healthy-america/resources/file/healthy-america-project-plan-2020.pdf\\n    \\nMessage from TransUnion on Healthy America:\\n\\nIn a world forever changed by the COVID-19 crisis, we’re committed to protecting American lives. TransUnion and its US-based healthcare technology partners have developed HealthyAmericaTM. This unique solution enables people to securely share test results, helping businesses, schools and consumers assess risks stemming from COVID-19 and interact in a safe, confident manner.\\nHealthyAmerica combines the power of TransUnion’s identity and fraud solutions, clinical data management capabilities of SiriusIQ, and business transformation assets of UST Global — together forming CLX Health, LLC. By leveraging and deploying our existing technology in a way consumers and businesses can readily adopt, it will be easier to mitigate risk in everyday interactions while maintaining individual privacy. Going forward, we expect airlines, large event organizers, restaurants and others will leverage the tool — which will easily adapt to changes in science parameters, including the evolution of a seasonal vaccine.\\n(https://solutions.transunion.com/healthy-america/?=undefined)\\n\\nWhat Healthy America is:\\n\\nCLX Health LLC, a joint venture company, has developed the HealthyAmericaTM mobile application to be deployed as a key component of the HealthyAmericaTM Solution Architecture and Database. The CLX Consortium of partner companies have come together to manage the spread of COVID-19 and other viruses by accessing real-time laboratory testing data for operational business and consumer decision support, ultimately allowing the economy to scale back up to capacity.\\nUtilizing existing technology and infrastructure critical to delivering a solution now, the CLX Consortium has network access to over 1 million physician offices, 22 largest by volume clinical laboratories, 40 major hospital systems and 20 Federally Qualified Health Clinics (FQHC) in the United States.\\nIn much the same way TSA PreCheckTM provided airline passengers with an increased level of confidence after 9/11, the HealthyAmerica application is positioned to mitigate risk of businesses and individuals. With TSA PreCheck in place, passengers returned to travel with assurance that fellow travelers had been screened and posed little to no risk. The HealthyAmerica application manages real-time and batch files of health status requests for consumers to provide businesses and facilities operational decision-making capabilities that can mitigate exposure to employees and clients.\\nLike the TSA PreCheck status, which is delivered in bulk to airlines and directly to the consumer via a Quick Response (QR) code, HealthyAmerica enables consumers to present a QR code indicating health status. With the HealthyAmerica QR code, individuals can securely gain access to government-restricted sites, such as airports and/or sporting events, as examples.\\nThe HealthyAmerica application works in the following manner, first requiring the individual consumer to register. Consumer identity is verified in combination with mobile device authentication, then the consumer selects a laboratory, schedules testing and receives validated test results—all within the application on the consumer’s verified device. The HealthyAmerica application stores diagnostic or antibodies test results received directly from an FDA-approved laboratory and generates a QR code indicating current health status.(https://www.siriusiq.com/siriusiq-introduces-clx-health-and-develops-healthyamerica-tm-as-virus-response-mobile-application/)\\nMy summary and analysis:\\n\\nOkay so this app basically gives verification to other people on whether you have Covid-19 or not wherever you go. First you start off by scheduling a testing through the app for antibodies and then you send the tests to SiriusIQ labs where they see if you have antibodies. TransUnion then verifies your identity through your social security number making sure it’s you. Then the data is stored in the app which is federally regulated and presents proof of your safety from Covid-19. You can also opt in or not for contact tracing on it to see who is infected and not. I think businesses, airports and big events like baseball games will soon require this because it‘s as simple as scanning a QR code or sending a verification online through the app to wherever you're going to check if you are safe to be there both to yourself and others. It provides a more organized and safer way to open up the country and European countries as well and yes they have been approved by the European Union on this. Anyways I think this can allow countries to  open up in a safer way then the first time they tried. This would help both the economy and stock market. This will all go down on August 6th at 3 pm (EDT) when they announce the application and the media is to announce it at that time as well.\\n \\nWho are these companies TransUnion is teaming up with?\\n\\nTransUnion- TransUnion is a global information and insights company that makes trust possible between businesses and consumers, by ensuring that each consumer is reliably and safely represented in the marketplace.

       "  'Alright guys so I\\'m one of the hosts on a YouTube channel named \"Max Tech\".  \\nI previously did YouTube work for the channel \"Appleinsider\" since 2016, making videos on Apple products which include Mac computers with Intel chips. \\n\\nI also grew up playing video games and building custom PCs right when AMD started to release six-core and 8-core processors that were cheaper than Intel CPUs and targeted towards gamers.  \\n\\nEven though the Intel chips were better for gaming, I still bought AMD because they were cheaper. Intel maintained the lead for many years since games really only used 4 cores, and Intel chips gave more consistent frame rates for gaming.\\n\\nAt one point, it was clear to me and to everyone else that Intel was intentionally holding off from innovating and improving their performance because they already owned a bulk of the market share. They realized that they could make more profit by making small improvements every year, while AMD was busting their ass trying to figure out how they can compete. (it was ultimately the gaming and custom PC market) \\n\\nMeanwhile.. Apple was using Intel chips quite successfully in their Mac computers the like MacBooks and iMacs. And Apple was also using their XEON chips for their higher-end machines. And of course, Intel was killing it in the server market.\\n\\nNow in 2013, Intel announced that they were working on their new 10nm chip process and that it should be ready to launch in 2015, and they said their 7nm chips should launch in 2017. \\n\\nBack to Intel, over the new few years, Intel delayed 10nm to 2016... and then to 2017.. and then to late 2019... We are now in 2020 and Intel is still shipping 14+++++ nm chips for high-end machines like the 2020 5K Apple iMac that was just released yesterday. Only laptops are getting the actual 10nm chips right now. \\n\\nIn 2017, AMD shocked the world by announcing their new Ryzen chips, and then also their Threadripper chips, and ever since then, they\\'ve been quickly catching up to Intel in terms of both performance and price. \\n\\nBecause of this, Intel instantly started lowering the price of their chips, and in 2018, they finally made 6-core chips for the MacBook Pro. 8-core chips in 2019, and now 10-core chips in 2020. This is an obvious and desperate move to try and compete with AMD. \\n\\nBecause Intel\\'s 10nm chips were not ready in 2015 or 2016, Apple\\'s redesigned 2016 MacBook Pro which was thinner than ever before, had overheating issues. The overheating was severe in 2018 with the 6-core chips that Intel made in fear of AMD. \\n\\nThere were even leaked emails from Intel executives worried about AMD\\'s price to performance beating out Intel. \\n\\nAnd right now, it is well known that AMD is making BETTER price-to-performance x86 chips. \\n\\nThe MOST important part of this discussion is that the tech community as a whole, including or YouTube and Reddit, are now convinced that AMD is the way to go. I\\'ve seen countless comments on my videos that are dissing on Intel chips and wishing that Apple would switch to using Intel. \\n\\nIf we make a build guide video using an Intel processor, we get shamed and called dumb for not using an AMD chip. Our Mac Pro videos got a ton of negative feedback because Apple is stupid for using Intel chips. Our 2020 MacBook Pro videos were getting comments dissing on Intel\\'s 10th-gen chips. The entire community is starting to hate Intel and preferring AMD.  \\n\\nAMD stock has increased over 11x since they announced the first Ryzen chips in August of 2016.  \\nIntel stock has only increased 38% since that same date. \\n\\nAnd looking towards the future.. Intel has recently delayed their 7nm chips until late 2022 or 2023. This caused their stock price to tank at they last earnings call. \\n\\nThere\\'s even now a class-action lawsuit against Intel because of this delay. \\n\\nThis also caused their chief of chip engineering to resign, and they reorganized their entire chip team. \\n\\nThey\\'ve even discussed outsourcing their future 6nm, 5nm and 3nm chip production to their rival foundry TSMC because they\\'ve lost confidence in their own foundry. \\n\\nSo it\\'s clear that Intel is getting killed by AMD with each passing year, and the tech community knows it. (Which is VERY important)   \\n\\n\\nThis brings us into the Apple and TSMC portion of this DD.   \\n\\n\\nBack in 2013, Apple announced their A7 chip for their iPhone 5s, the first 64 bit smartphone chip, and ever since then, there was a massive performance war between Apple and Qualcomm, fighting to create the fastest smartphone chips, in which Apple ultimately won. \\n\\n(The A13 in the iPhone 11 Pro is still much faster than the Snapdragon 865+ which was just recently released this year) \\n\\nStuck in the middle of this battle was TSMC, which has been the EXCLUSIVE manufacturer of Apple Silicon chips for their iPhones and iPads since the A10 chip in 2016. \\n\\nAnd in 2018, Apple released their 11\" iPad Pro with the A12X chip manufactured by TSMC\\'s 7nm process. This iPad from 2 years ago is so powerful that it still outperforms the new 2020 13\" MacBook Pro with Intel\\'s 10th gen chip in both processor AND graphics performance. \\n\\nNow, Apple is about to announce their iPhone 12 in about a month that\\'s gonna pack the A14 chip which is being built on TSMC\\'s brand new 5nm process. \\n\\nAnd of course, the next iPad Pro will get a much improved A14X 5nm chip, and it\\'s the same story for the Apple Silicon Mac chips that will start being released later this year in October/November. \\n\\nI\\'m of course, talking about Apple finally ditching Intel and moving forward with their own chips. This makes sense for Apple for various different reasons.\\n\\n1: They can run iPhone &amp; iPad apps on their Macs.\\n\\n2: They control both the software and hardware for incredibly amounts of performance optimization.\\n\\n3: They can make sure every new Mac update gets a new chip with performance improvements instead of relying on Intel to release improved chips. \\n\\n4: This is of course, much cheaper for Apple since they don\\'t have to pay Intel the high price of their chips. \\n\\n5: They don\\'t have to deal with overheating issues since most Intel chips are still on 14nm technology, therefore running very hot and using a lot of power.   \\n\\n\\nAnd there\\'s a good chance that the very first Apple Silicon Mac chips are gonna outperform the current Intel chips, stay much cooler and give you much better battery life. \\n\\nJust to give you some perspective in terms of how Intel\\'s 10nm compares to TSMC\\'s 5nm..\\n\\nIntel 10nm transistor density: around 100 million transistors per square millimeter.\\n\\nTSMC 5nm transistor density: around 171 million transistors per square millimeter. \\n\\n  \\nTSMC has already confirmed that they\\'re working on risk production of their new 3nm process in 2021,  with those chips going into 2022 iPhones, iPads and Macs. \\n\\nSo here\\'s what the future looks like:\\n\\n  \\nIntel 7nm in late 2022/2023 : 240 million transistors per square millimeter\\n\\nTSMC 3nm shipping in 2022 Apple products: 290 million transistors per square millimeter\\n\\nAnd apparently, TSMC is already working on plans for their 2nm process for 2024.   \\n\\n\\nAnd due to Intel\\'s past, there\\'s a very good chance that Intel could delay 7nm even further, especially since they had to restructure their entire chip team, while TSMC has been on point.   \\n\\n\\nSo the future isn\\'t looking very bright for Intel\\'s chip technology compared to TSMC. No wonder why they wanted to outsource their chips from them.   \\n\\n\\nAnd one last bit on Apple\\'s switch to their own chips built by TSMC. \\n\\nApple has already given developers their transition kit which is a Mac Mini with an A12Z chip from their iPad Pro. \\n\\nOne developer tweeted this: \"At this point, I think that the first gen Apple Silicon machines will be faster at running x86 code than an actual x86...\"  \\n\\n\\nWhat he means is that Apple\\'s new Rosetta 2 emulation software is so good that he thinks it\\'ll outperform Intel chips even though it\\'s not running natively for ARM. \\n\\nSo basically, Apple made the right choice by ditching Intel.   \\n\\n\\nAnd if Apple proves everyone wrong by coming out with incredibly great Macs thanks to their switch to their own Apple Silicon ARM-based chips, then there\\'s a VERY good chance that the rest of the market will follow them and start developing ARM-based chips for laptops.\\n\\nThis will force Windows to start heavily investing in their ARM-based Windows software. \\n\\nAnd if you didn\\'t already know.. Intel is FAR behind in the ARM-based chip world.   \\n\\n\\nNow, the most common argument I hear is this: Apple is only a tiny part of Intel\\'s business, and while that may be true.. the MOST important thing is the public\\'s view of Intel.  \\n\\n\\nThe tech community is already starting to despise Intel as a brand name because of their overpriced processors and the fact that AMD is beginning to CRUSH them. \\n\\nJust wait until Apple Silicon Macs start getting released and people realize that ARM-chips have a ton of potential, and they\\'ll start hating Intel even more. \\n\\nThis will cause Intel\\'s brand recognition and reputation to get absolutely destroyed in favor of AMD and Apple Silicon. This alone will lead to less market share. And what will happen if Nvidia or Apple buy out ARM? \\n\\nAnd by the way, there are now more and more ARM-based servers popping up, so there\\'s a good chance that Intel will start to lose market share on the server side if ARM-based servers prove themselves. (They use less power so this makes sense for server farms)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBasically, what I\\'m trying to say is that Intel just got ditched by Apple.. and they\\'re getting killed by AMD and TSMC. ARM is coming VERY quickly and Intel is NOT ready. They have been plagued with delay after delay, and all of this drama will ruin the confidence of their staff, leading to lowered productivity. It\\'s not looking good for Intel for the long-term.  \\n\\n\\nAs of right now, Intel stock is very cheap, and you might make a few bucks if you trade short term.. but I wouldn\\'t hold Intel stock long term.   \\n\\n\\nIf you want more in-depth info with visuals and extra details, you can check out two videos I made on the Max Tech Youtube channel: \\n\\n\"How Intel Lost the CPU Race..\"\\n\\n\"Apple Silicon ARM Chips vs Intel x86 Processors for Mac?\"\\n\\nHopefully you enjoyed this DD.'],\n",

       "  'Someone has recently pointed out this company to me. I did a lot of research and now believe it’s the best trading opportunity for Aug 2020. I’ve compiled my own and other investors\\' research – read below.\\n\\n**Overview**\\n\\nXeris Pharmaceuticals (XERS, see https://www.xerispharma.com) looks completely overlooked and undervalued. They\\'ve recently created a breakthrough product (Gvoke HypoPen) that is now believed to be the best emergency treatment for severe hypoglycemia (low blood sugar – see https://www.healthline.com/health/hypoglycemia). \\n\\nThe Gvoke HypoPen (see https://www.gvokeglucagon.com) is similar to an EpiPen (it treats hypoglycemia in an emergency situation). There is a huge market for this due to the growing number of people diagnosed with diabetes. According to an older CBS article \"371 million people had diabetes globally in 2012… By 2030, they expect 552 million people will have the disease.\" (see https://www.cbsnews.com/news/371-million-people-have-diabetes-globally-about-half-undiagnosed).\\n\\nIt is apparent that hospitals, schools, and regular businesses will be phasing out their Glucagon medical kits for the new Gvokes. Furthermore, there are millions of individual diabetics that will want to have these accessible in case of emergency. \\nGvoke is currently covered by about 80% of insurance companies in the US with $0 copay. Moreover, Gvoke is close to approval in EU. The company’s debt is very reasonable and they have plenty of cash on hand. Xeris actually has trouble producing enough Gvokes to meet all the recent demand.\\n\\n**Catalysts**\\n\\nThere seems to be a perfect storm of factors that could propel the XERS stock and options into the stratosphere:\\n\\n•\\tRecently launched (July 1st) game-changing product (Gvoke HypoPen, see https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xeris-pharmaceuticals-announces-gvoke-hypopen-110000083.html)\\n\\n•\\tEarnings report &amp; conference call - Mon 08/10/20\\nDue to new sales of Gvoke HypoPen, the next ER is likely to show solid numbers (see https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xeris-pharmaceuticals-announce-second-quarter-200500496.html)\\n\\n•\\tActive Stock/Low float\\nThe stock has been very active and liquid recently with over 2M shares traded daily (with a tight spread of $0.01 most of the time). XERS has a pretty low float of about 27M shares with 58% held long-term by institutions.\\n\\n•\\tReduced stock price (about $3.30 and rising at the time of writing)\\nThe XERS price has recently dropped due to overreaction to a public offering. It presents a great opportunity to purchase at the right price\\n\\n•\\tShort squeeze\\nRecently increased short borrow rate across various brokers (see https://twitter.com/dteb16/status/1287783290347368449, as an example) makes shorting XERS much harder. Between that, the upcoming ER + other good news, we are likely to see a major short squeeze in the next few weeks\\n\\n•\\tGeorge Soros – recently disclosed a 5.3% stake (about 2.5M shares) in the company (see https://www.smarteranalyst.com/yahoo/xeris-spikes-12-after-hours-on-soros-stake-analyst-says-buy/amp). It’s a great sign when such prominent investors purchase a large block of stock in line with 58% of total institutional ownership\\n\\n•\\tMedium 12-month XERS price target (based on 4 analysts) is $12.50, with a high forecast of $15.00 (see https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/xers/price-target, https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-beaten-penny-stocks-look-193735305.html). \\n\\n•\\tA $4.1M contract (see https://beta.sam.gov/opp/acb59c12ce004ebf832c456d8c10d283/view) was awarded to Xeris on July 1st by the Department of Veteran Affairs, which is for some reason still unannounced\\n\\n•\\tMany other products at different developmental stages in the company’s pipeline (several versions of Glucagon, Diazepam, Pramlintide-Insulin, etc.) – see https://www.xerispharma.com/research-development/pipeline\\n\\n**Risk/Reward**\\n\\nIt seems to me that the reward far outweighs the risk in this case. There’s an overwhelming amount of evidence pointing to the significant upside (see Catalysts).\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nThere is already a major buzz around the stock and the price is starting to reflect it. With everything that’s happening, my conservative target for XERS stock is $15-$17 within the next few months (would make options earn a very nice multiple). Everything feels like XERS is getting ready to explode.\\n\\n**TLDR:**\\nI am currently buying/accumulating XERS stock and options - 09/18/20 $5c, 10/16/20 $5c &amp; 01/15/21 $5c. This looks like a great ground-floor opportunity to me. If you agree – join me before all other investors pile in and price explodes. \\n\\nThese are my own opinions, I\\'m not a financial advisor.

To have Google invest into a home automation/security company like this is huge for VVNT, and cements their perceived value among potential buyers. I am happy to do a comps analysis of ADT and VVNT but don't have time today and earnings are too close to wait, but if this gets enough traction I am happy to do a comparative analysis and show all the valuation multiples ADT at their selling price and compare it to VVNT to get an approximate value of their worth. \\n\\n**How are sales doing now?**\\n\\nSo last time I posted a few dudes accused me of being an employee of VVNT, which I'll take as a compliment. I know a lot of sales managers and talk to them about how their teams are doing, and the consensus is the same: sales are the same or better than they were last year. Here's the catch: \\n\\nAs I explained last post, the majority of their sales are during the summer months. Due to Covid, they got a late start to the summer. However, now they have pushed all of their major incentives to those who finish selling through September and October which will make up for the lost sales during Covid. Will salesmen do this? They think so, because the incentives are too good and so many colleges aren't opening up, so the college age salesmen are waiting til the winter to resume school.\\n\\nGuy I talked to yesterday said he has made more money this year than he ever has, and that's starting late. \\n\\n**Earnings Surprise**\\n\\nLast Earnings, CEO Todd Peterson said: \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c9fk6tuqcef51.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2075ccc35ea50242210dc3fc81ccf30f7de9c720\\n\\nSome context: in the past, as he said, VVNT used to raise bonds to finance their operations. They also absorbed all of the costs for the client usually so the acquisition costs were pretty high. Now they can finance their costs and the salesmen I talked to said they have been offloading those costs into the clients this year. Customers now pay higher up front fees and it hasn't impacted sales! This is potentially huge, which is why I believe we will see a significant surprise at the earnings call. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR; buy VVNT shares, calls, or warrants. \\n\\nMy positions: VVNT $15c 8/21, 21,000 Warrants, and 4200 shares.

I took the same concepts to design out a system to do the same with live stonk data, and other data related to stonks (social media, WSB daily discussion, whatever).\\n\\n**The KODK Case Study**\\n\\nIn my KODK back test, the algorithm which I am running is fed 1 year of training data up to EOD Friday, July 24th and is then fed \"live\" data in 10 min snapshots on July 27th starting at pre-market trading.  It uses the training data to evaluate what\\'s considered abnormal on the actual live day (or tested live day) of training so as to not give it the ability to see into the future and simulate running it live.  \\n\\nMy algo arrived at a threshold of around 500k shares as being a volume anomaly for KODK.  By 12:50pm EST on July 27th, some 675k shares had been traded that day.  \\n\\n**BaCkTesTinG is ImPorTanT**\\n\\nFor the backtesting,  I wrote my own engine because I was too lazy to read the zipline docs and didn\\'t need all the feature bloat.  I setup a DB which houses a few decades worth of properly cleaned  historical stock data to use as training data, and I paid out the ass for a quality firehose of 1 min tick data.  I can develop and simulate the algo locally then deploy the live streaming system + detection into my AWS environment.  For broader tests, I can also effectively \"replay\" whatever day I want in AWS across all of my detection systems.\\n\\n**Autism as a Service (AaaS)** ™\\n\\nWhile my back testing engine can either run locally or in AWS, the actual live AaaS platform I built around an AWS loosely coupled architecture so that I can easily scale it out as I come up with more signatures.    I did this intentionally for one primary reason:\\n\\n\\\\- I needed the ability to stream aggregate 10 min snapshots of market data across some 8k tickers, with low latency, feeding the data in and running it across multiple detection algorithms.  \\n\\nBasically, I needed a pub/sub data bus, with the detection algos running as their own subscribers against \"publishers\" of live data, with each algo able to scale out/scale in depending on load.  I didn\\'t want to live in the hell that is managing my own Kafka deployment, or the auto scaling logic, when AWS could do that for me\\n\\nIn caveman terms-one script, one computer, too much data, too slow\\n\\nAt this point, I\\'ve got the back end built out, a DB to house my alerts, and have been focused on writing detection rules.

RDHL drug opaganib (easy to make) , when approved with EUA, can sell to a multi-billion dollar market immediately.\\n\\n2.. The RDHL trial design are very strategic imo. Targeting high-covid countries that will do anything to open the economy. Already approved for trial in UK, Russia, USA, Mexico, Europe. \\n\\n3.. Having the phase three trial in these countries means the drug is readily available there. Need no time to scale up and distribute. Even better is just to license it in Mexico and Russia. **It will be very high margin**. \\n\\n4.. The bar to meet is very low , because Remdesivir is not really good. **Any improvement in efficacy will have countries fighting head-over-heels** to get their hands on it. The drug gave very good phase 1 result, prompting countries approving their phase three rapidly. \\n\\n5..Company is active, posting PR on every trial development. This is good PR but not excessive.

There is no guarantee that drug will work 100% on covid, but it’s a LOW risk SUPER high reward play. In the last earning call, management mentioned that trial cost is near-negligible. On the REWARD side, if play out, this drug will place RDHL on the same field as Gilead.  \\n\\n7.. There are other drugs in phase three, but this could be one of the fastest.

ARM is a \"prospective\" type of chip good for low-power consumption. It hasn\\'t been developed enough to produce the same computing power as X86 yet, but in the future it will.

Ipads, Iphones, Ipenis, you name it. \\n\\nSome people say ARM will replace X86 someday. Who fucking knows. \\n\\nBut on the manufacturing side of things, ARM, just like X86, is just a manufacturing LICENSE in its essence. It\\'s just a bunch of design drawings. ***Actually*** MANUFACTURING these CPUs and GPUs is so expensive and so complex that practically only two companies can supply and meet the material demand **licensing** companies such as AMD, Apple, and Nvidia ask for. That\\'s TSMC and samsung. And samsung is too gay to trade on NYSE/Nasdaq.\\n\\nPoint is, all of the incredibly hyped CPU and GPUs of 2020 and in recent years which everyone will buy will be coming out of TSMC in 2020.

       "  'NIO Inc. NIO is slated to release second-quarter 2020 results on Aug 11, before the opening bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal second-quarter loss per ADS of 34 cents has remained stable for the past 60 days. The year-ago loss was 45 cents per ADS. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $486 million, suggesting an uptick from $220 million reported in the prior-year quarter.\\n\\nFactors at Play\\nIncreasing demand for NIO’s ES6 and ES8 models is likely to reflect on the firm’s second-quarter 2020 results. NIO delivered 10,331 vehicles in the quarter to be reported. The figure exceeded the firm’s guidance and increased 191% from the year-ago level.\\n\\nNIO’s battery swap technology is a game changer and is likely to aid the company’s results for the quarter to be reported. The technology that is part of NIO’s BAAS (Battery-as-a-Service) strategy has been helping to save time when charging an EV and alleviating range anxieties. As of May 26, 2020, NIO Power completed more than 500,000 battery swaps, becoming one of NIO’s most well-received power services.\\n\\nDuring the quarter, the company secured around $1 billion in new financing from China’s economic development authorities, which shored up its cash balance. In June, China-based internet behemoth Tencent Holdings increased stake in NIO to 15.1%. Cash infusion from investors and increasing efforts to expand the company’s sales network started to yield benefits. These factors are instilling confidence on the stock and are likely to reflect positively on its second-quarter results.\\n\\nHowever, the company has been bearing the brunt of operational inefficiency over the last several quarters. While rising deliveries are expected to have positively impacted NIO’s revenues, escalating R&amp;D as well as SG&amp;A costs are likely to have dented operating margins. \\n\\nEarnings Whispers\\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for NIO. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\\n\\nEarnings ESP: Tesla has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.\\n\\nZacks Rank: It carries a Zacks Rank of 3 currently.\\n\\nWhile our model does not indicate an earnings beat for the electric vehicle startup NIO, some of the auto companies that delivered better-than-expected results for second-quarter 2020 include Tesla TSLA, O’Reilly ORLY and Group 1 Automotive GPI.  \\n\\nBiggest Tech Breakthrough in a Generation\\nBe among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity. Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices. In the process, it’s expected to create 22 million jobs and generate $12.3 trillion in activity.\\n\\nA select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout accelerates for this new tech. Early investors could see gains similar to buying Microsoft in the 1990s. Zacks’ just-released special report reveals 8 stocks to watch.

Looking at their numbers and their market cap of 70 billion, I believe we can justify a market cap of **$25 billion** for SE's gaming division\\n\\n---\\n\\n**E-Commerce** \\n\\nThis is what makes SE the powerhouse that it is. Don’t take my word for it. Let’s look at their web traffic compared to the some of it’s competitors, including the BABA-backed competitor Lazada\\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/lJc7N2N\\n\\nTheir QOQ growth is absolutely absurd, and absolutely demolishing the competition. They currently have a QOQ growth of **33%**, demolishing Lazada’s 5% by miles. They also have the highest average monthly active users and time in app on android in the shopping category compared to any other app on the market AND #1 in downloads.\\n\\n\\nAt this rate, they have has potential to be the BABA of Southeast Asia, which currently has a **$750,000,000,000** market cap. Considering the GDP of southeast asia is about a quarter of the GDP as China, if SE can get the same penetrance as BABA, that would justify a market cap of $175 billion. Currently, I’d give it a market cap of **$90 billion**\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**Digital Payments**\\n\\nJust look at SQ and this part will be a no brainer. They’re making pennies right now ($11.5 million), but they’re growing at an absolutely absurd **325%**. It’s way too early to be making any sure-thing judgment calls right now at such a low revenue, but seeing how they started to pick up and dominate the other markets, it wouldn’t surprise me if this growth is sustained as well. Staying at this rate for the next 4 years can turn that measly 11.5 million into **$1.3 billion**. (11.5 million * 3.25^4)\\n\\nConsidering SQ’s market cap of 70 billion, I think **$10 billion** is a completely fair evaluation, with that number being much higher if SE continued to show outrageous levels of growth like in this sector \\n\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nSE is an absolute growth monster. These numbers are just my estimates based on the performance I’ve already seen of seen. With the justifications above, I believe SE should currently be worth over $125 billion, implying another **80%** upside *right now*. However, with 94% revenue growth YOY, that number will quickly balloon as SE continues to dominate the Southeast Asian market. In my opinion, this is an absolutely brain-dead easy opportunity to hop in on the next Amazon before it’s too late\\n\\nHalf of my account is currently in 9/18 160c. They seem to have a post-earnings floor at $145/share so if they hit that again, I plan to average down with 11/20 180c.\"],\n",

And note the gray ghost line in the mkt share chart- that\\'s an extrapolation of the trend from the prior three years, pre-COVID anomaly. I even gave them a 25% long-term boost in market share (e.g. 1.20% vs. 0.95%) above the three-year trend, assuming they get a big \"eyeballs\" benefit from having had this temporary blip of lockdown sales. The estimates show, even with those generous assumptions, they\\'re *still* going to see **2Q21 qtrly yoy sales of -50% or worse**.

Think about matching that trajectory to the coming EV/Sales line, and hence, the stock chart.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2wrdzp51zbk51.jpg?width=980&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=085b4e7bc491abec45f57f159a59778515cc6817\\n\\n**Skip to the bottom for the rec**, but if you want some honey mustard dipping sauce to go along with your short/put OSTK tendies, here it is:\\n\\nEven on top of what you just saw above, this is an excellent short: Overstock is a market-share-losing company within the shitty industry of selling and delivering home furnishings. The industry deals with expensive shipping, logistics/returned/damaged-merch challenges, thin margins, and no barriers to entry. Remember how anytime AMZN announces it’s entering an industry, all the existing industry players get killed? Yeah, AMZN is competing here. Also some little guys named Walmart, Target, Wayfair, Houzz, and hundreds of others.\\n\\nIt gets better: they\\'re also still distracted by and wasting scarce resources on a tech fad/bubble from a couple years ago that is unmentionable here. They even tried to sell the main retail business (98% of their sales!) to focus on the aforementioned fad; there were no buyers. Profitability has been non-existent since this company started… more than 20 years ago.\\n\\nEven including last quarter’s COVID anomaly, if I’d plotted OSTK’s market share against just the *e-commerce* portion of the Home Furnishings industry, which is outgrowing the rest, not only would OSTK’s lockdown market share spike be flatter or non-existent, the long-term declining trend in its market share would be *even more pronounced* vs. its e-commerce peers.\\n\\n# The bottom line:\\n\\nThey report 3Q20 on \\\\~Oct 29th; sales will def still be up *yoy* (the tail of the aforementioned pull-forward in home furnishing sales), but up way less than the +109% anomaly for 2Q20, and ***def down QoQ*** (this is for the LF-degens, see below). Hard to predict exactly how the market will react to just that qtr, and certainly depends on whether it’s trading at/above the highs of last week.\\n\\nI\\'m short shares, because at the very least, the dried turd hits the fan when they put up the big negative yoy numbers in 2Q21. If the stock stays elevated for long enough and/or climbs higher in the meantime, I\\'m also backing up the truck on spring+ 2021 far-OTM Puts.\\n\\n**TLDR;** OSTK sales and mkt share collapsing- long-term price target **$15** (that\\'s being generous).\\n\\n**High-functioning degenerates:** Short shares, keep some powder dry for margin/DCA in case it shoots higher in the interim.\\n\\n**Common degenerates:** far-OTM Puts, Mar \\'21 or later, as they come available.\\n\\n**Low-functioning degenerates:** you know'],\n",

Theres one thing you\\'re forgetting: what the dystopian future is going to look like.\\n\\n\\n\\n1) FB Yardsale groups became popular throughout the last several years, so much so that FB added an official Marketplace feature to their platform. [This nerd](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/29/how-facebook-marketplace-replaced-craigslist-in-2020.html) wrote an entire article about how FB marketplace replaced the need for craigslist in his personal life. Im currently downsizing my stupid material possessions so I can have more money to invest for sweet tendies, and I too am using FB Marketplace instead of craigslist. Why? It\\'s attached to peoples profiles, rather than the shady anonymity craigslist offers. \\n\\nThis month, FB released Facebook Shops which gives businesses with FB pages a webshop directly on the social media platform. This is brand-spanking-new, and has the potential to compete with Amazon in a major way. I buy shit off Amazon all the time, and a lot of the stuff sold there is cheap garbage made overseas. The Coronavirus pandemic has woken Americans up to the dangers in relying on foreign manufacturing for the majority of our goods, and I predict that we will see a rebound in American manufacturing in the next decade.\\n\\nAs this rebound occurs, more and more businesses will be looking for a way to brand, advertise, and sell their product online. Historically Facebook has offered the first two of these services, and now they offer the third.\\n\\n2) FB Horizons. FB has been one of the leading companies putting research and development into virtual reality. FB acquired Oculus in 2014 for $2b. In 2017 Zucc came out and said FB will likely spend up to $3b in the next decade on VR research and development. Their interest is not only in VR experienced and games, but also in building an actual virtual world. [Forbes is already reporting](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyhackl/2020/08/30/social-vr-facebook-horizon--the-future-of-social-media-marketing/#1985f3f85b19) on the potential economic implications of Horizons, which could effectively create virtual townsquares wherein individuals could purchase goods with the convenience of online shopping and the personability &amp; experience of shopping at small local businesses. \\n\\n3) Libra. Zucc has been spending some time in front of congress recently as the boomers there grill him with a confusing mixture of interest/excitement and suspicion/angst. One of the Fed\\'s main concerns is the desire for Libra Project to house their cryprocurrency in Switzerland rather than the US. Even if Libra is cucked by the big dick of the federal government, there\\'s nothing anybody can do about an internal currency system. If Libra isn\\'t able to have success in the \"real\" world, then it still could exist in the new virtual world that Facebook is creating. If Libra does have success in the real world, thats all to the better for FB.\\n\\nThe expansion of research into VR is peeling back the covering of an uncomfortable but certain truth: we still don\\'t fully understand the depth and power of what the internet truly is. In 5 years your wife\\'s boyfriend will be able to own a VR brothel where you and a horde of other simps cough up zuccbucks you made selling shitty crystal bracelets to nomadic hippies through FB Shops so that you can be rewarded with an orgasm delivered by electrical stimulation to your prostate via Papa Elon\\'s neuralink.

The Mods shift the burden of persuasion on the author who is banned from the subreddit and has no platform to preach. Technically what I am doing is against WSB rules. Posting on an alt account if your main is banned. I had to deliver though, too many eager eyes waiting for this follow up. To conclude, WSB ban policy needs to be reworked.\\n\\n**If my credibility is restored, continue to read the updated DD**\\n\\n**What was missed in first post**\\n\\nA theory was floating around that the $5 billion in debt that [VALE paid off](https://www.reuters.com/article/vale-brazil-debt/brazils-miner-vale-to-pay-creditors-and-reset-revolving-credit-lines-filing-idUKL1N2GB0SA), was funded by Tesla. The debt was disbursed in March 2020, during the covid crash. $2 billion was due by June 2022 and $3 billion was due December 2024. Tesla raised $5 billion capital through shares. Tesla said they intend to use the cash to “strengthen its balance sheet and for general corporate purposes”. That is a pretty broad statement. An analyst from Roth Capital partners said “They will need cash for all the facilities they are building, and **new growth initiatives**,”([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/tesla-stock/tesla-launches-5-billion-capital-raise-tapping-in-on-share-surge-idUSKBN25S4W2))\\n\\nThe connection people were making, is that Tesla raised capital to give Vale. Both articles wet public within 24 hours of each other.   \\n\\n\\n“**VALE DRILLING :(”**\\xa0\\n\\nYes but no. After a shoot up in the morning, VALE fell for a couple of reasons\\n\\n* Entire Market was bloody\\n* Quad witching madness\\n* Exchange rate fluctuations\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Processing img xe4tohvqldo51...*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Processing img thoiloluldo51...*\\n\\nClose price on the Brazilian exchange was 61.66/5.3876 =$11.44\\xa0\\n\\nThis is why after hours, VALE was hanging around 11.44 but now the dip is being bought so it is back up to $11.59. **What to take away:** Vales down movement today was closer to -0.69%. The rest was currency fluctuation. A little unfortunate but that’s what we get for playing a Brazilian rock farm.  \\n\\n\\n**What were the whales doing?**\\n\\nToday from market open until 9:55, ALL the FlowAlgo was bullish\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Processing img fedza4c0mdo51...*\\n\\nThe whales were also buying into the 10/16 call contracts HARD. I’m cautiously optimistic. While the Najarian brothers live by following the Smart Money, it seems like it could be a lure.\\xa0\\n\\nWhales probably know we love VALE and they saw the 10/16 chain was empty, so they got in and are going to price fix it now, like how you would price fix the market in FIFA Ultimate Team.\\xa0\\n\\n10/16 also does not cover any earnings or special dates, just random.\\xa0\\n\\nToday was another high volume day for shares and options.\\xa0\\n\\nVolume: 46,142,890\\n\\nOptions volume\\xa0\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Processing img sfa9h3h4mdo51...*\\n\\nWhile the general sentiment among the options chain is bullish, there was an increase in p/c ratio for O/I\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Processing img 627272q7mdo51...*\\n\\nWhat this means is that the majority of trading was bullish today. Roughly 1 put was traded for every 11 calls. However, the open interest is now showing Roughly 1.17 puts exist for every 1 call. Whether these are “sell to open” puts is another question. The general sentiment in the options chain is still bullish. P/C ratio can be very misleading, going into ERIC Q2, the P/C was 11. That means there were 11 puts for every 1 call. ERIC beat earnings and then gapped up.\\xa0\\n\\nMy reaction to today’s movement was the following. A perfect day to scare retail traders away,\\xa0\\n\\nFriday nerves holding into the weekend combined with a currency fluctuation. Buy low, sell high.\\xa0\\n\\nI bought more positions today.\\xa0\\n\\n**What’s keeping me bullish?** \\n\\nEverything from my initial DD post and some new information is keeping me bullish. VALE is not a meme stock. They are pretty well established and very large, just underlooked by retail. Whales continuing to pile in is keeping me bullish, along with the sneaky upgrades from Thursday and [Friday](https://zolmax.com/investing/vale-nysevale-upgraded-by-zacks-investment-research-to-strong-buy/4807283.html).\\n\\nGIGA metals is extremely bearish right now, CEO and Execs sold shares at the top and they have been getting beat down for three straight days,\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Najarian** is very outspoken about his VALE position on CNBC. 2 days in a row he mentioned it. He is both long stock and long calls.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n**VALE EV PRESENTATION 2018**\\n\\nA lot of good information on demand for nickel was in [Vale’s presentation](http://www.vale.com/EN/investors/information-market/presentations-webcast/PresentationsWebcastsDocs/BofA%20-%20May%202018%20-%20Bob%20Morris%20vFinal_i.pdf)  \\n\\n\\n*Processing img 2rbuq1jkmdo51...*\\n\\nThe Nickel demand in 2018 was benchmarked at 38 in comparison to a 260/590 (conservative/upside) by 2025 and 890/1700 by 2030.  \\n\\n\\nNickel demand for batteries wass 3% of the market in 2017. It is projected to be 37% of the market in 2030.\\xa0\\n\\nVale gives a disclaimer that the variance of range is 50% to the upside and 50% to the conservative side.\\xa0\\n\\nThis growth alone is reason to long VALE.\\n\\n**WSB comments**\\n\\nBecause I am banned, I cannot see the comments anymore. However, their were some interesting comments in the original VALE DD post. Those that I recall are\\n\\n* Friend works at VALE, can’t say anything but I am holding a lot of calls\\n* Apparently, there was a meeting in toronto between VALE and Tesla\\n* Someone said that he orders 70k every month (or year I forgot) from VALE and they are a good company\\xa0\\n\\nInterpret how you will, comments could be fake.\\n\\n**Ex Dividend date**\\n\\nMany expressed concern that the ex dividend date would be devastating for the 9/25 calls. This is true, but at the same time if the big news comes out on batteryday/ex date. The price action could plow through ex date. This is also why I have longer expiration calls.   \\n\\n\\nIn Tesla’s Q2 earnings call, they mentioned the word “nickel” that alone was enough to get the mining stocks to move up.   \\n\\n\\n**If nothing happens**\\n\\nIf there is no mention of VALE or nickel on battery day, the stock will be hard to dump because VALE has 5 billion outstanding shares. Compared to LAC, who rallied 10% on Friday, the have 90 million outstanding shares.\\n\\n**THE TWEETS**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Processing img e2077b8pmdo51...*\\n\\n“Speedrunning Factorio in real life …”\\n\\nFactorio’s game description\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Processing img wmvcwiitmdo51...*\\n\\n**I rest my case**\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nVALE has potential for explosive movement on 9/22. If nothing happens on 9/22 there is still reason to long the stock and load up on longer expiration calls/leaps and continue to roll.   \\n**Positions**\\n\\n**VALE** shares, 9/25 $13.00c, 1/15/21 $12.00c, 3/19/21 $12.00c, 10/2 $11.50c\\n\\ndisclaimer: none of this is financial advice, this is for educational and entertainment purposes only. nothing in this post should be construed as financial advice or a recommendation to buy or sell any sort of security or investment.'],\n",

This will cover two primary subjects, number one, Intel VS AMD and their competitive advantages, including nodes, partnerships and foundries along with how I expect things to play out over the next few years.\\n\\n**Intel VS AMD**\\n\\n*The following documents Intel’s most recent launch and the potential inconsistencies I found, please be aware that the reviewers are not at fault and should not be blamed for anything that is potentially foul play.*\\n\\n***Cascade Lake and a story of deception***\\n\\n[Intel 10900k](https://preview.redd.it/t9l7el4iudo51.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66b0fa720fcf9d783c5092a42a8ce8207d15d895)\\n\\nThe x86 CPU space has two companies currently competing in it. One is the master and one is subservient, but what happens when these roles get reversed and the master becomes the underdog? \\n\\nThe fight gets dirty.\\n\\nEver since the launch of the Zen architecture, AMD has been slowly gnawing away at Intel’s market share, Zen 1 brought them back into the discussion, Zen+ consolidated their position and Zen 2 brought the fight to Intel’s crown jewels. Intel in the years since Zen launched floundered with 10nm, and now 7nm while TSMC slowly ran away with their lead in manufacturing all the while AMD continued to innovate. This left Intel with two choices, buckle down and try to work the problem, or fight dirty. They chose the latter.\\n\\nIn 2018, well before Zen 2 launched, AdoredTV investigated Intel and their relation with reviewers and found that Intel was most likely seeding the tech press with golden samples. The scale of this was astonishing, almost all sites that he investigated had received exceptional samples. \\n\\nThis was in 2018, when Intel was still firmly in the lead when compared to AMD’s Zen+ architecture. What about now? When AMD is on par or firmly in the lead with Zen 2?\\n\\nInspired by Adored’s Conlake video, I chose to look into any potential foul play with their newest 10900k launch.\\n\\n***Methodology***\\n\\nIn order to ensure that Intel was fairly portrayed, I looked into as many publications that I could who published their all core overclocks along with their voltages set in the bios. All in all I found 17 publications that fulfilled the criteria.\\n\\nAfter I had collected the necessary data, I reached out to Silicon Lottery to ask about higher bins than what they published, that being 5.2 GHz, and 5.3 GHz.\\n\\nThey kindly responded to me and provided this information:\\n\\n*“I can tell you that 1) we do not publish statistics until we reach a sample size of at least 100,*\\n\\n*and 2) there are a few 10900K that can fall within our theoretical 5.2GHz bin (we're talking about top \\\\~1% here), but a 5.3GHz bin is not possible for a 10900K under our tests.”*\\n\\nFrom this statement we can safely assume that their theoretical 5.2 GHz bin would use 1.4 volts as each 100 MHz bump is matched by an increase of 0.025 volts, with their highest binned parts reaching 5.1 GHz at 1.375 volts.\\n\\nWith that out of the way let’s move onto my findings.\\n\\n***Findings***\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qlan4vkrtdo51.png?width=577&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d17d3f53fb045dc3af44d0fda3e2ac85f01caa9\\n\\n*\\\\*Power draw from the wall was about equivalent to that of Guru3D, implying a voltage of 1.4 volts.*\\n\\n*\\\\*\\\\*JayzTwoCents did not mention the voltage used, but I felt it was important to mention him as his result was completely out of line when compared to other sites.*\\n\\nThe first important note that should be made is that for some of the sites, they started with a voltage of 1.35 and applied a multiplier without doing any further tuning, meaning some of these publications could have achieved a better overclocking result. Secondly, because of the nature of some reviews, I could not get as many sources as I originally intended, but 17 should suffice for our needs.\\n\\nWith that out of the way, we can look at a few numbers, the average clock speed achieved and the average voltage necestated.\\n\\n**Average all core overclock:**\\n\\n*5.164 GHz*\\n\\n**Average Voltage:**\\n\\n*1.341 Volts*\\n\\nAnd we can also determine the mean all core overclock and voltage, which will be important to ensure the results are not skewed by aberrant values such as with JayzTwoCents and Overclock 3D.\\n\\n**Mean all core overclock**\\n\\n*5.1 GHz*\\n\\n**Mean Voltage:**\\n\\n*1.332 Volts*\\n\\nAs we can see, both the average and the mean samples would be considered Golden samples by Silicon lottery, who have had less than 100 samples achieve similar results. It is clear that something is a little fishy here, so let’s take a deeper look into the results.\\n\\nStarting with Guru3D, the first result that completely blew me away, 5.2 all core overclock with only 1.35 volts applied. When compared to Silicon Lottery of less than 1% of samples reaching 5.2 GHz under their testing with the assumed 1.4 volts. Even if we are generous and add an extra 0.025 volts to ensure long term stability, Guru3D’s review sample far exceeds the theoretical requirements for a 5.2 GHz, golden sample bin. \\n\\nMoving onto the next stand out, Overclocker 3D, we see an absolutely astonishing result, 5.4 GHz with a voltage of 1.402. Silicon Lottery stated that they do not believe it is possible for a 10900k to reach 5.3 GHz all core, let alone 5.4 GHz. This sample is definitively a golden sample, in all likelihood, Silicon Lottery has never seen a part that can perform this well despite testing hundreds of chips. \\n\\nAll other chips are excellent samples as well, with the vast majority of them landing in golden sample territory or at worse, good samples.\\n\\nThat being said, there is one outlier, JayzTwoCents. I am not entirely sure what happened here, it is the only chip that did not make 5.0 GHz, and is the only chip that would not be considered a good bin. Perhaps some wires got crossed or he was sent a retail unit by accident.\\n\\n***Conclusion***\\n\\nMake of this what you will, but I feel that this is a clear demonstration that Intel is again seeding press with golden samples. This could have been done by them to quell the rumours that the 10900k would be a power hog or to potentially dull the edge of any potential reviews, but it is pretty clear that something is amiss. \\n\\nIt is also clear that Intel will continue to pull shenanigans until we call them out for it. I feel that the press should be a little more discerning or more skeptical of their results given what I have found and what Adored found in the past.\\n\\nFinally if you plan to buy an Intel product, please be aware that misleading information such as this is present and be aware of it.\\n\\n***Sources and Footnotes***\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mse7izj9udo51.png?width=663&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd19e2f2deb5d2fa6f966e0026003e9dcce82bea\\n\\n**The future of Intel?**\\n\\nAs we can see, Intel is not shy about potentially deceiving press and consumers. That being said, I do not expect to see any legal consequences come of this as it is very difficult to ascertain if this did indeed happen.\\n\\nThat being said, the pain has just begun for Intel. The following will encompass a brief overview of some Intel products and the major issues they will be facing in the near future.\\n\\n***The death of a leading foundry***\\n\\nIn my last post, I said that Intel would not be highly competitive in 2022. While I admit, I was hoping to get the follow up post out much sooner, what I meant by this is Intel will not have 7nm until 2022 at the earliest. That being said, with Intel’s most recent quarterly earnings, I have to readjust my personal road map for Intel, and I now believe they will be competitive again at earliest, 2023. There are a few reasons for this, and the following will be based upon leaks from Moore’s Law is Dead, AdoredTV and RedGamingTech. All three have proven to be reliable sources, with Moore’s Law is Dead predicting almost the exact performance of Intel Tiger Lake months in advance.\\n\\nCurrently, as we all are aware of, Intel is encountering massive difficulties with their 10nm and 7nm production. The issues are so prevalent that 10nm has been delayed for years, and 7nm will be delayed for just as long if not longer. Because of this they have been forced to delay product launches, back port architectures and increase power consumption massively to keep pace with AMD. \\n\\nThat being said, they cannot continue to increase power consumption in all sectors, for example, in note books, AMD recently launched their much anticipated Renoir APUs, which far exceed both press and my expectations. At the moment AMD’s solutions are notably stronger in multithreaded tasks and graphics work loads when compared to Intel Cascade Lake and Intel Ice Lake. In fact, according to Hardware Unboxed, a reputable review channel, it is not uncommon to see AMD perform at twice the level as Intel when comparing low power solutions (15 watt TDP or lower). That being said, Intel Tiger Lake is a good improvement in terms of GPU performance, outclassing AMD by \\\\~20% in the 15 W form factor, while still being significantly weaker in multithreaded performance.\\n\\nThis shows that Intel absolutely needs 10nm yesterday, they cannot continue to increase power and lose efficiency, sooner or later they will find that even though their products consume twice the power, they are out classed in all aspects. That wall will be Zen 3.\\n\\n[AMD 3950x](https://preview.redd.it/a29o16umudo51.jpg?width=1344&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d12b43cb90019ef1bf776266e6b1234e7d38a99)\\n\\n***Zen 3***\\n\\nThis will be brief as not much has changed from my previous post, and I still fully expect AMD to take the gaming crown from Intel Cascade Lake. However, there are a few small updates that I must make. Intel Rocket Lake is expected to come out Q1 or Q2 of 2021, and it will have 8 cores at most. Though I am not sure why Intel would want to max their consumer platform at only 8 cores, and not maintain 10 cores, I suspect that 10 cores may consume too much power. However, it will have a 10-20% IPC bump, which *might* allow it to reclaim the gaming crown from Zen 3, though at the moment it could be a toss up depending on how well Zen 3 scales with frequency. \\n\\nFurthermore, I will clarify a few things: \\n\\n1. Zen 3 will have a unified cache, meaning that latency should be lower as packets do not have to cross over the infinity fabric.\\n2. Zen 3’s cores will have more access to L3 cache as it is unified, meaning it will have to access system memory less, thereby again improving latency.\\n3. Zen 3 should have a small clock speed increase from an improved node, though I suspect it will be no more than 200 MHz\\n4. Finally, Zen 3 should also have a higher f-clock, meaning it will have lower latency when accessing the system memory.\\n\\nAll in all, Zen 3 is a relatively iterative performance increase over Zen 2, with a 15-20% increase in single threaded performance being likely.\\n\\n***Big and Little cores Vs Zen 4***\\n\\nA few months ago, Moore’s Law is Dead detailed Alder Lake and Sapphire Rapides; Intel’s “big” comeback. The following will be a summary of what he detailed, and I strongly recommend you watch his video to understand my reasoning to what will happen: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqErX7VkitI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqErX7VkitI)\\n\\nThe gist of it:\\n\\n1. Alder Lake will be on 10nm, and will utilize “big cores” with high ipc, and “little cores” with low ipc, and low power consumption.\\n2. Alder Lake will come out late 2021 or early 2022.\\n3. Sapphire Rapides will be Intel’s big splash back into the data center, and will succeed Ice Lake server.\\n4. Sapphire rapides will most likely have 56 cores.\\n\\nMy opinion:\\n\\nThough we have very little information on Zen 4, we know one thing for certain, it will be on 5nm TSMC. You may immediately see the issue, in my last post I said that 5nm was designed to compete with Intel 7nm, not 10nm. AMD will still have a node advantage. This along with what we know so far, Zen 4, will increase core counts substantially again, and it will be an advanced package solution, this shows that unless Alder Lake and Sapphire Rapids come out two quarters or more before Zen 4, it will not be competitive. \\n\\nThis is a major issue for Intel because as I detailed previously Intel’s roadmap is massively behind schedule and I believe that all products that have yet to be announced, such as Alder Lake and Sapphire rapids will have been delayed by at least a few months. These delays will be further compounded by Intel’s wording security problems forcing companies to either purchase more Intel products as a stop gap, or migrate over to AMD.\\n\\n***Data Center and the Cloud***\\n\\nIf you work in the server space, you know that security is paramount, and as I said in my last post, Intel has none of it. Now you may ask, why is Intel still selling massive amounts of CPUs to various OEMs such as Dell? Here is the reason as detailed by Mike Burzonne (who is supporting the Federal Trade Commission v Intel Corp. Dockets 9288 and 9341) on SeekingAlpha:\\n\\n“Average OEM price where I suspect deeper discounts are available for large volume bundles and hyperscale / cloud commercial.\\n\\nDesktop $283.79\\n\\nMobile $282.13\\n\\nXeon $715.04”\\n\\nNow the astute may see the issue, Intel is selling these for much less than their suggested retail value. Essentially what these large OEMs are doing is, buy Xeons on the cheap, burning through them in about a year, then purchasing new ones. Obviously this is not sustainable, so they are potentially looking at AMD. \\n\\nMike Burzonne also believes that AMD ships about 50m units per year compared to the 400m of Intel, and from this the issue is clear, they do not have enough capacity to bring on these large OEMs in any meaningful way, plus the software stack is not entirely mature yet. \\n\\nNow if you look at the software stack, this is a very real head wind, but things are slowly changing, when Zen 3 is released, the Zen architecture will be just about 4 years old, which is typically when you start to see software maturity at around 5 years. This compounded with improved efficiency over Zen 2 should allow AMD to make a very convincing argument to not buy Xeons. Furthermore, we also know that AMD is ramping wafer orders from TSMC thus they should be able to increase shipments and bring large OEMs on board.\\n\\nThe way that Intel is going to combat this is by selling Xeons on the cheap while showing off what they have coming down the pipeline to incentivise companies to make do with their current products. The issue with this is they have proven time and time again that they do not have the ability to execute, as proven most recently by the 7nm delays.\\n\\n***Trouble with the FTC***\\n\\nThis will be very brief as I do not entirely understand the ins out outs of the suit, but the reason I specifically brought up Mike Burzonne was his involvement in an anticompetitive suit against Intel for monopolistic practices as summarized in my first post. Mike Burzonne believes that total damages could exceed 20b and a 2010 revision states 88B in damages.\\n\\nThe reason why the charges are so slow to move is Mike Burzonne believes that the FTC and the European Union are synchronizing to ensure that the charges are proper and cannot be easily dismissed, nor will there be lasting economic tensions as Intel is a US based cooperation.\\n\\nIf you wish to read more about the suit, here is the 2010 revision: [https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public\\\\_comments/proposed-consent-agreement-matter-intel-corporation-corporation-ftc-docket-no.9341-550006-00014%C2%A0/550006-00014-55228.pdf](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_comments/proposed-consent-agreement-matter-intel-corporation-corporation-ftc-docket-no.9341-550006-00014%C2%A0/550006-00014-55228.pdf)\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6miicxssudo51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c10575c5850a57d5dcdcf7c54b0e570b282dba30\\n\\n**Conclusion/TLDR**\\n\\nAs I believe I highlighted very clearly, Intel is increasingly starting to turn to more shady tactics to paint themselves in the best light possible, such as with the Cascade Lake reviews, they are losing ground to AMD in efficiency and performance, they are losing server market share and they have a potential massive lawsuit on the horizon. \\n\\nAll of this should demonstrate that AMD has a golden opportunity to gain massive market share as Intel toils with 10nm and 7nm.\\n\\nOne final thing I should note, is that the FTC lawsuit is very much uncertain, and I would be wary of basing any decisions on it. \\n\\nFinally, I see AMD as worth 150B in the next few years as they eat Intel’s lunch, cloud compute continues to grow rapidly, and their collaborations with Xbox and PS5 bear fruit.\"],\n",

People were praising me as “DD god” and the comments piling in. About 6 hours after the post went live, it started to get “lost” behind other satire posts and low quality content. I was confused as to why because the post seemed like it was getting a lot of traction and appreciation. (97% upvote ratio) My theory is that somehow it was being pushed down. I have no evidence for this claim but this could explain the crazy award to like ratio.\\xa0\\n\\n**“Boofin on Vyvanse”**\\n\\nCan confirm this is accurate. The smoke on the west coast makes going outside very uncomfortable (coming from someone who doesn’t like huddling indoors) I decided to start writing the DD at 1am. Wrote an outline. Woke up for the market open, spent 16 hours writing it and not trading. Read over it and then decided to post the next day.\\xa0\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2tz63hl9xdo51.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d17e9915eab55b60127d708bcd0f9e465d37dab9\\n\\nu/nanaboostme\\n\\nu/nanaboostme has been my biggest follower since I posted the $VALE DD.

I never even saw the RKT post.\\n* Never once have I traded RKT or even had it on my watchlist\\n* u/nanaboostme has no evidence to support his claim.

This was shadowbanned from the subreddit and was only viewable if you had a direct link. :/\\n\\nI end up deleting the post and telling my friend to post it.

Nowhere to be found. A couple minutes later it was outright deleted. I message a couple mods, no response. My friend who posted $VALE GANG TRAILER got *banned* from r/wallstreetbets.\\n\\n**Quote a fallen soldier**\\n\\n\"On the pinned “advice” post, Mods heavily implied with only omission of name that Vale was a pump and dump and attacked my credibility and motives, when pressed in the comments they backtracked. Saying that my post was well made and they had no issues with it, however this is not true. I was shadow banned for my post and refused explanation from mods at all.\"[From this youtube video](https://youtu.be/VOhModuPCno)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0gy05m6qxdo51.jpg?width=821&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9de21b20ff00b3c39abd81956a9d7cd37760ee2b\\n\\nThen u/CHAINSAW_VASECTOMY posts his pinned post about being wary with “advice”. I get to respond once in the comments. A couple minutes later u/CHAINSAW_VASECTOMY responds and *locks* the post. This was the start of the chaos.\\n\\nAlso, the VALE DD post was buried as well, bad algo? Or jealous mods?

No, I am *not* selling you those dirt cheap contracts. No, I am not working for Goldman Sachs. No, I am not using WSB to bring volume into an options chain. One of my main reasons for entry in $VALE was the unusual activity coming from whales.\\xa0\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dbru0bttxdo51.jpg?width=1036&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc3da2d913c8ed5fe6e9c8a1eb9087087c8c9609\\n\\nThe 1/15/21 chain was especially flooded with whale volume. I will explain the updated whale activity down below in the DD. I am still holding my positions and do not need WSB to pump my contracts. I’m relying on a price action movement to bring intrinsic value into my contract. I’M NOT FUCKING SELLING!\\n\\n[**Shifting burden of persuasion**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shifting_burden_of_persuasion)\\n\\nWhen I am accused of shilling/pumping/being an outsider/pumping/baiting/selling contracts to buyers, the need for evidence or fact is absent. There is no evidence that indicates I was intentionally posting the DD with sinister motives. However, now that I am on my heels with no factual claims being made, I have to rewrite the constitution to prove my innocence. If a Mod wants to remove/shadowban, ideally they must have some evidence in order to do so. Otherwise their range of power is larger than acceptable. They could ban or *not ban* anything without justification or evidence. If abused this is a very dangerous system of management. The Mods shift the burden of persuasion on the author who is banned from the subreddit and has no platform to preach. Technically what I am doing is against WSB rules. Posting on an alt account if your main is banned. I had to deliver though, too many eager eyes waiting for this follow up. To conclude, WSB ban policy needs to be reworked.\\n\\n**If my credibility is restored, continue to read the updated DD**\\n\\n**What was missed in first post**\\n\\nA theory was floating around that the $5 billion in debt that [VALE paid off](https://www.reuters.com/article/vale-brazil-debt/brazils-miner-vale-to-pay-creditors-and-reset-revolving-credit-lines-filing-idUKL1N2GB0SA), was funded by Tesla. The debt was disbursed in March 2020, during the covid crash. $2 billion was due by June 2022 and $3 billion was due December 2024. Tesla raised $5 billion capital through shares. Tesla said they intend to use the cash to “strengthen its balance sheet and for general corporate purposes”. That is a pretty broad statement. An analyst from Roth Capital partners said “They will need cash for all the facilities they are building, and **new growth initiatives**,”([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/tesla-stock/tesla-launches-5-billion-capital-raise-tapping-in-on-share-surge-idUSKBN25S4W2))\\n\\nThe connection people were making, is that Tesla raised capital to give Vale. Both articles wet public within 24 hours of each other.\\n\\n“**VALE DRILLING :(”**\\xa0\\n\\nYes but no. After a shoot up in the morning, VALE fell for a couple of reasons\\n\\n* Entire Market was bloody\\n* Quad witching madness\\n* Exchange rate fluctuations\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xb0perowxdo51.jpg?width=368&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00ecbba08c28d7205431ceeb9818929d7fd635c2\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/flfiv9gxxdo51.jpg?width=692&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0544f56dfcb616ec78000761467f01be4bb766ca\\n\\nClose price on the brazilian exchange was 61.66/5.3876 =$11.44\\xa0\\n\\nThis is why after hours, VALE was hanging around 11.44 but now the dip is being bought so it is back up to $11.59. **What to take away:** Vales down movement today was closer to -0.69%. The rest was currency fluctuation. A little unfortunate but that’s what we get for playing a brazilian rock farm.**What were the whales doing?**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/syidbj4zxdo51.png?width=1812&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dc4710c842fecef2e411c94adc45cc716225bcb\\n\\nToday from market open until 9:55, ALL the FlowAlgo was bullish\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe whales were also buying into the 10/16 call contracts HARD. I’m cautiously optimistic. While the Najarian brothers live by following the Smart Money, it seems like it could be a lure.\\xa0\\n\\nWhales probably know we love VALE and they saw the 10/16 chain was empty, so they got in and are going to price fix it now, like how you would price fix the market in FIFA Ultimate Team.\\xa0\\n\\n10/16 also does not cover any earnings or special dates, just random.\\xa0\\n\\nToday was another high volume day for shares and options.\\xa0\\n\\nVolume: 46,142,890\\n\\nOptions volume\\xa0\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yrgkxkc1ydo51.jpg?width=829&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24178d0e093b3238131d6efb2f93796ca9eca61e\\n\\nWhile the general sentiment among the options chain is bullish, there was an increase in p/c ratio for O/I\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oeqg7c34ydo51.jpg?width=204&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=007805ab2c362fb12a8f8435c755a5b141921c26\\n\\nWhat this means is that the majority of trading was bullish today. Roughly 1 put was traded for every 11 calls. However, the open interest is now showing Roughly 1.17 puts exist for every 1 call. Whether these are “sell to open” puts is another question. The general sentiment in the options chain is still bullish. P/C ratio can be very misleading, going into ERIC Q2, the P/C was 11. That means there were 11 puts for every 1 call. ERIC beat earnings and then gapped up.\\xa0\\n\\nMy reaction to today’s movement was the following. A perfect day to scare retail traders away,\\xa0\\n\\nFriday nerves holding into the weekend combined with a currency fluctuation. Buy low, sell high.\\xa0\\n\\nI bought more positions today.\\xa0\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**What’s keeping me bullish?**\\n\\nEverything from my initial DD post and some new information is keeping me bullish. VALE is not a meme stock. They are pretty well established and very large, just underlooked by retail. Whales continuing to pile in is keeping me bullish, along with the sneaky upgrades from Thursday and [Friday](https://zolmax.com/investing/vale-nysevale-upgraded-by-zacks-investment-research-to-strong-buy/4807283.html).\\n\\nGIGA metals is extremely bearish right now, CEO and Execs sold shares at the top and they have been getting beat down for three straight days.\\n\\n**Najarian** is very outspoken about his VALE position on CNBC. 2 days in a row he mentioned it. He is both long stock and long calls.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**VALE EV PRESENTATION 2018**\\n\\nA lot of good information on demand for nickel was in [Vale’s presentation](http://www.vale.com/EN/investors/information-market/presentations-webcast/PresentationsWebcastsDocs/BofA%20-%20May%202018%20-%20Bob%20Morris%20vFinal_i.pdf)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hkp7yuv6ydo51.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4306c23d6f37d697c8af77145f0ce1827711ddb\\n\\nThe Nickel demand in 2018 was benchmarked at 38 in comparison to a 260/590 (conservative/upside) by 2025 and 890/1700 by 2030.\\n\\nNickel demand for batteries wass 3% of the market in 2017. It is projected to be 37% of the market in 2030.\\xa0\\n\\nVale gives a disclaimer that the variance of range is 50% to the upside and 50% to the conservative side.\\xa0\\n\\nThis growth alone is reason to long VALE.\\n\\n**WSB comments**\\n\\nBecause I am banned, I cannot see the comments anymore. However, their were some interesting comments in the original VALE DD post. Those that I recall are\\n\\n* Friend works at VALE, can’t say anything but I am holding a lot of calls\\n* Apparently, there was a meeting in toronto between VALE and Tesla\\n* Someone said that he orders 70k every month (or year I forgot) from VALE and they are a good company\\xa0\\n\\nInterpret how you will, comments could be fake.\\n\\n**Ex Dividend date**\\n\\nMany expressed concern that the ex dividend date would be devastating for the 9/25 calls. This is true, but at the same time if the big news comes out on batteryday/ex date. The price action could plow through ex date. This is also why I have longer expiration calls.\\n\\nIn Tesla’s Q2 earnings call, they mentioned the word “nickel” that alone was enough to get the mining stocks to move up.\\n\\n**If nothing happens**\\n\\nIf there is no mention of VALE or nickel on battery day, the stock will be hard to dump because VALE has 5 billion outstanding shares. Compared to LAC, who rallied 10% on Friday, the have 90 million outstanding shares.\\n\\n**THE TWEETS**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/un5h51t8ydo51.jpg?width=364&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a1cf38a9dbc056e7d4863b48affe5b0ce27fa03\\n\\n“Speedrunning Factorio in real life …”\\n\\nFactorio’s game description\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zw68pm5aydo51.jpg?width=544&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62feefd344e670b72d0009e926e425774eb609cf\\n\\n**I rest my case**\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nVALE has potential for explosive movement on 9/22.

Most of these jobs are in Brazil, but some others in Canada. Much of the Brazilian jobs are infrastructure focused, with many being preventative and corrective maintenance supervisors.

Their particular submission per the wording of the 510k rule is that they are saying that the device has not been changed or modified to the extent that its safety or effectiveness has been compromised. Nanox is not saying that the product is the same as other products, but that it was not changed in such a way to make it a fundamentally new product that would require a lengthy approval process!\\n\\nNANOX\\'s filing for FDA clearance was submitted and finally accepted by the Third Party Program of FDA.

So, I don't think short term puts are a good idea here. As a result, I'm looking at the January 2021 puts. However, the bid ask spread kinda sucks dick, so I would recommend 15 puts over this next week, since you won't get the lower OTM puts for cheap\\n\\ncheck my previous dd posts if you want some proof that I don't fuck around when I post\\n\\nBecause the mods are a bunch of 500 pound shutins, I gotta add a bunch more to this post even though it’s solid. Idk about you, but I really feel like taking a shit right now, coffee helps me clear out my bowels, and I think that’s why coffee drinkers are ahead of the game\"],\n",

Although these won\\'t be bonafide Wuhan Flu cases, UNH will still have to pay out for the MD/hospital services rendered.

Only Toyota Nissan and Honda are managing to tread water.\\n\\nBut Tesla is going to be an exception this year for the auto industry.\\n\\nAfter coronavirus, we should see people frantically trying to buy cars because they don't want to take subways. People don't want to be in enclosed areas with thousands of other people. This fear will continue even after the virus is contained. They still need to get around though, and that's where cars come in. \\n\\nProblem is that having petrol cars, especially in major cities, comes with large costs that put off people from buying one. EV cars get around a lot of these costs. The biggest incentive is license plate quotas. In Shanghai and Beijing, license plates are on a lottery system and the cost can be almost as much as the car itself. Millions of people will want a car RIGHT NOW, they don't want to wait year after year to win the lotto and get a plate. They don't trust subways and buses, they are scared for the next epidemic, and they want a car as soon as possible. So what do they do?\\n\\n# They buy an EV.\\n\\nTesla is ahead of all other EV companies, even the ones in China. They've undercut NIO, their products are superior to products from BYD, and many of the models by Chinese car companies are built like compliance cars. The XPeng P7 may be able to compete on cost and value, but they don't have the capacity to supply cars to the millions of customers who want an EV this year. \\n\\nTesla has the supercharger network that they are ramping up this year in China. This is a huge advantage over other companies, because a Tesla owner can use both the supercharger network and the current charging network built by the government and third parties. Most people in China live in apartments, with limited access to charging at home so charging infrastructure matters more than most places.\\n\\nTesla will be building its own batteries. They don't have to worry about battery constraints as the other competitors do. They're going to be able to bring down the price of the most expensive part of an EV lower than their competitors can acquire, and it's going to get even lower. As scale of production ramps up, Tesla can increase its marginal revenue holding prices constant, because the cost of each Tesla they produce is going down. Labour costs are also cheaper in China. The more China slows down, the slower cost of labour goes up.\\n\\nThe price is right. $46,000 USD seems high, but millions of people in China spend that much just to buy a regular petrol car along with the price of the license plate. Large families (most likely to buy a car because they don't want their kids getting kung flu from the subway) pool their money for large purchases, enabling them to buy houses and cars without financing. \\n\\nOut of all EV car companies, Tesla will be the one on top.\"],\n",

       " ['QSR',\n",
       "  'TL;DR at the end.\\n\\nI believe $QSR is due for a sharp price increase over the next 3 months for the following reasons:\\n\\nFirst it is important to understand what Restaurant Brands International ($QSR) is. This is a joint venture started in 2014 which owns Burger King, Tim Hortons, and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen. A majority of their holdings consist of BK and TH, and Popeyes is a minority at around 15% of their total restaurants. However, it is important to note that historically Popeyes has been a weak performer for $QSR compared to their other brands but this may have changed for Q3 with their release of a new chicken sandwich which triggered a social media frenzy and resulted in their selling out of the sandwich with Tyson foods unable to keep up with demand.\\n\\nNow let’s break down by restaurant why $QSR may beat:\\n\\n- Burger King sales in Q3 May have been driven by Impossible Burger demand as reported [Here](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/16/the-impossible-whopper-is-driving-steady-traffic-to-burger-king-data-shows.html).\\n- Popeyes as stated above had a huge demand for their sandwich after its release in August which likely drove up sales quite significantly.\\n- Tim Horton’s did not have any driving factors during Q3 which would indicate an increase in sales but there is no reason to believe they will report a decrease either.\\n\\nNow let’s look at where the stock sits as of today. $QSR has consistently sold off over the past 2 months after setting a new ATH at $78 in late August. The stock now sits in the $69-$70 range, only 3% higher than the stock’s high point in 2017 despite strong growth over the past 2 years. Sell side price targets average near $93 representing over a 30% upside from the current trading price.\\n\\nOkay so this thing could pop, what play should I chose? Historically, $QSR has not been very volatile so short dated options are probably not the best idea to play earnings. Instead, I would recommend longer dated options expiring in January or later At or Near The Money. Hopefully strong earnings will create demand and drive price higher, which has the potential to short squeeze the stock due to the large short volume which would be forced to cover after such an increase.\\n\\nIn their earnings call I would expect them to announce strong EPS and Rev while increasing guidance in anticipating the growth of meat alternative products at their restaurants.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n$QSR may run up to the high 80’s over the next 3 months due to strong performance among their 3 brand holdings in Q3 and a potential short squeeze.'],\n",

I just wanted to hear from people who are thinking SHOP will beat or what you think will happen on earnings. (Feb 12th before market open)\\n\\nThe specifics of my logic is based on the fact that Q4 growth seems to be slowing about 20% every year with the last 3 years being 85% (2016), 71% (2017), and 54% (2018). I think its realistic to think we would actually see a growth of around 34% which would translate into roughly $472M which is below the estimates range of revenue which is 475.45M - 493.14M.\\n\\nSo come on bulls tell me how my options are gonna end up worthless.
